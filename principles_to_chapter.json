Man\u2019s most distinctive quality is our singular ability to look down on reality from a higher perspective and synthesize an understanding of it. While other species operate by following their instincts, man alone can go above himself and look at himself within his circumstances and within time (including before and after his existence). For example, we can ponder the ways that nature\u2019s flying machines, swimming machines, and billions of other machines, from the microscopic to the cosmic, interact with one another to make up a working whole that evolves through time. This is because the evolution of the brain gave man a much more developed neocortex, which gives us the power to think abstractly and logically.\n", "While our higher-level thinking makes us unique among species, it can also make us uniquely confused. Other species have much simpler and more straightforward lives, without any of man\u2019s wrestling with what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad. In contrast with animals, most people struggle to reconcile their emotions and their instincts (which come from the animal parts of their brains) with their reasoning (which comes from parts of the brain more developed in humans).

That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not worth having a bottom-up perspective. In fact, to understand the world accurately you need both. By taking a bottom-up perspective that looks at each individual case, we can see how it lines up with our theories about the laws that we expect to govern it. When they line up, we\u2019re good.\n", "By looking at nature from the top down, we can see that much of what we call human nature is really animal nature. That\u2019s because the human brain is programmed with millions of years of genetic learning that we share with other species. Because we share common roots and common laws, we and other animals have similar attributes and constraints. For example, the male/female sexual reproduction process, using two eyes to provide depth perception, and many other systems are shared by many species in the animal kingdom. Similarly, our brains have some \u201canimal\u201d parts that are much older in evolutionary terms than humanity is. These laws that we have in common are the most overarching ones. They wouldn\u2019t be apparent to us if we just looked at ourselves.\n", "If you just looked at one species\u2014ducks, for example\u2014to try to understand the universal laws, you\u2019d fail. Similarly, if you just looked at mankind to understand the universal laws, you\u2019d fail. Man is just one of ten million species and just one of the billions of manifestations of the forces that bring together and take apart atoms through time. Yet most people are like ants focused only on themselves and their own anthill; they believe the universe revolves around people and don\u2019t pay attention to the universal laws that are true for all species.\n", "To try to figure out the universal laws of reality and principles for dealing with it, I\u2019ve found it helpful to try to look at things from nature\u2019s perspective. While mankind is very intelligent in relation to other species, we have the intelligence of moss growing on a rock compared to nature as a whole. We are incapable of designing and building a mosquito, let alone all the species and most of the other things in the universe. So I start from the premise that nature is smarter than I am and try to let nature teach me how reality works.\n", "a.

To get good results, we need to be analytical rather than emotional.\n", "Whenever I observe something in nature that I (or mankind) think is wrong, I assume that I\u2019m wrong and try to figure out why what nature is doing makes sense.

To help explain why, I will give you a simple example.\n", "When I went to Africa a number of years ago, I saw a pack of hyenas take down a young wildebeest. My reaction was visceral. I felt empathy for the wildebeest and thought that what I had witnessed was horrible. But was that because it was horrible or was it because I am biased to believe it\u2019s horrible when it is actually wonderful? That got me thinking. Would the world be a better or worse place if what I\u2019d seen hadn\u2019t occurred? That perspective drove me to consider the second- and third-order consequences so that I could see that the world would be worse. I now realize that nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual, but most people judge good and bad based only on how it affects them. What I had seen was the process of nature at work, which is much more effective at furthering the improvement of the whole than any process man has ever invented.\n", "Most people call something bad if it is bad for them or bad for those they empathize with, ignoring the greater good. This tendency extends to groups: One religion will consider its beliefs good and another religion\u2019s beliefs bad to such an extent that their members might kill each other in the mutual conviction that each is doing what\u2019s right. Typically, people\u2019s conflicting beliefs or conflicting interests make them unable to see things through another\u2019s eyes. That\u2019s not good and it doesn\u2019t make sense. While I could understand people liking something that helps them and disliking things that hurt them, it doesn\u2019t make sense to call something good or bad in an absolute sense based only on how it affects individuals. To do so would presume that what the individual wants is more important than the good of the whole. To me, nature seems to define good as what\u2019s good for the whole and optimizes for it, which is preferable. So I have come to believe that as a general rule:\n", "b. To be \u201cgood\u201d something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and contribute to the evolution of the whole; that is what is most rewarded. For example, if you come up with something the world values, you almost can\u2019t help but be rewarded. Conversely, reality tends to penalize those people, species, and things that don\u2019t work well and detract from evolution.17\n", "In looking at what is true for everything, I have come to believe that:\n", "c. Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe; it is the only thing that is permanent and it drives everything.18 Everything from the smallest subatomic particle to the entire galaxy is evolving. While everything apparently dies or disappears in time, the truth is that it all just gets reconfigured in evolving forms. Remember that energy can\u2019t be destroyed\u2014it can only be reconfigured. So the same stuff is continuously falling apart and coalescing in different forms. The force behind that is evolution.\n", "For example, the primary purpose of every living thing is to act as a vessel for the DNA that evolves life through time. The DNA that exists within each individual came from an eternity ago and will continue to live long after its individual carriers pass away, in increasingly evolved forms.19\n", "As I thought about evolution, I realized that it exists in other forms than life and is carried out through other transmission mechanisms than DNA. Technologies, languages, and everything else evolves. Knowledge, for example, is like DNA in that it is passed from generation to generation and evolves; its impact on people over many generations can be as great or greater than that of the genetic code.\n", "Evolution is good because it is the process of adaptation that generally moves things toward improvement. All things such as products, organizations, and human capabilities evolve through time in a similar way. It is simply the process by which things either adapt and improve or die. To me this evolutionary process looks like what you see on the right:\n", "Evolution consists of adaptations/inventions that provide spurts of benefits that decline in value. That painful decline leads either to new adaptations and new inventions that bring new products, organizations, and human capabilities to new and higher levels of development (as shown in the top diagram on the facing page); or decline and death, which looks like the diagram at bottom left.\n", "Think of any product, organization, or person you know and you will see that this is true. The world is littered with once-great things that deteriorated and failed; only a rare few have kept reinventing themselves to go on to new heights of greatness. All machines eventually break down, decompose, and have their parts recycled to create new machines. That includes us. Sometimes this makes us sad because we\u2019ve become attached to our machines, but if you look at it from the higher level, it\u2019s really beautiful to observe how the machine of evolution works.\n", "From this perspective, we can see that perfection doesn\u2019t exist; it is a goal that fuels a never-ending process of adaptation. If nature, or anything, were perfect it wouldn\u2019t be evolving. Organisms, organizations, and individual people are always highly imperfect but capable of improving. So rather than getting stuck hiding our mistakes and pretending we\u2019re perfect, it makes sense to find our imperfections and deal with them. You will either learn valuable lessons from your mistakes and press on, better equipped to succeed\u2014or you won\u2019t and you will fail.\n", "As the saying goes:\n", "d. Evolve or die. This evolutionary cycle is not just for people but for countries, companies, economies\u2014for everything. And it is naturally self-correcting as a whole, though not necessarily for its parts. For example, if there is too much supply and waste in a market, prices will go down, companies will go out of business, and capacity will be reduced until the supply falls in line with the demand, at which time the cycle will start to move in the opposite direction. Similarly, if an economy turns bad enough, those responsible for running it will make the political and policy changes that are needed\u2014or they will not survive, making room for their replacements to come along. These cycles are continuous and play out in logical ways\u2014and they tend to be self-reinforcing.\n", "The key is to fail, learn, and improve quickly.

History has shown that all species will either go extinct or evolve into other species, though with our limited time window that is hard for us to see. But we do know that what we call mankind was simply the result of DNA evolving into a new form about two hundred thousand years ago, and we know that mankind will certainly either go extinct or evolve into a higher state. I personally believe there is a good chance man will begin to evolve at an accelerating pace with the help of man-made technologies that can analyze vast amounts of data and \u201cthink\u201d faster and better than we can. I wonder how many centuries it will take for us to evolve into a higher-level species that will be much closer to omniscience than we are now\u2014if we don\u2019t destroy ourselves first.\n", "One of the great marvels of nature is how the whole system, which is full of individual organisms acting in their own self-interest and without understanding or guiding what\u2019s going on, can create a beautifully operating and evolving whole. While I\u2019m not an expert at this, it seems that it\u2019s because evolution has produced a) incentives and interactions that lead to individuals pursuing their own interests and resulting in the advancement of the whole, b) the natural selection process, and c) rapid experimentation and adaptation.\n", "a. The individual\u2019s incentives must be aligned with the group\u2019s goals.To give you a quick example of nature creating incentives that lead to individuals pursuing their own interests that result in the advancement of the whole, look at sex and natural selection. Nature gave us one hell of an incentive to have sex in the form of the great pleasure it provides, even though the purpose of having sex is to contribute to the advancement of the DNA. That way, we individually get what we want while contributing to the evolution of the whole.\n", "b. Reality is optimizing for the whole\u2014not for you. Contribute to the whole and you will likely be rewarded. Natural selection leads to better qualities being retained and passed along (e.g., in better genes, better abilities to nurture others, better products, etc.). The result is a constant cycle of improvement for the whole.\n", "c. Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable. Natural selection\u2019s trial-and-error process allows improvement without anyone understanding or guiding it. The same can apply to how we learn. There are at least three kinds of learning that foster evolution: memory-based learning (storing the information that comes in through one\u2019s conscious mind so that we can recall it later); subconscious learning (the knowledge we take away from our experiences that never enters our conscious minds, though it affects our decision making); and \u201clearning\u201d that occurs without thinking at all, such as the changes in DNA that encode a species\u2019 adaptations. I used to think that memory-based, conscious learning was the most powerful, but I\u2019ve since come to understand that it produces less rapid progress than experimentation and adaptation. To give you an example of how nature improves without thinking, just look at the struggle that mankind (with all its thinking) has experienced in trying to outsmart viruses (which don\u2019t even have brains). Viruses are like brilliant chess opponents. By evolving quickly (combining different genetic material across different strains), they keep the smartest minds in the global health community busy thinking up countermoves to hold them off. Understanding that is especially helpful in an era when computers can run large numbers of simulations replicating the evolutionary process to help us see what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n", "In the next chapter I will describe a process that has helped me, and I believe can help you, evolve quickly.

Through our own eyes, we are everything\u2014e.g., when we die, the whole world disappears. So to most people (and to other species) dying is the worst thing possible, and it is of paramount importance that we have the best life possible. However, when we look down on ourselves through the eyes of nature we are of absolutely no significance. It is a reality that each one of us is only one of about seven billion of our species alive today and that our species is only one of about ten million species on our planet. Earth is just one of about 100 billion planets in our galaxy, which is just one of about two trillion galaxies in the universe. And our lifetimes are only about 1/3,000 of humanity\u2019s existence, which itself is only 1/20,000 of the Earth\u2019s existence. In other words, we are unbelievably tiny and short-lived and no matter what we accomplish, our impact will be insignificant.

Though most people think that they are striving to get the things (toys, bigger houses, money, status, etc.) that will make them happy, for most people those things don\u2019t supply anywhere near the long-term satisfaction that getting better at something does.20 Once we get the things we are striving for, we rarely remain satisfied with them. The things are just the bait. Chasing after them forces us to evolve, and it is the evolution and not the rewards themselves that matters to us and to those around us. This means that for most people success is struggling and evolving as effectively as possible, i.e., learning rapidly about oneself and one\u2019s environment, and then changing to improve.\n", "It is natural that it should be this way because of the law of diminishing returns.21 Consider what acquiring money is like. People who earn so much that they derive little or no marginal gains from it will experience negative consequences, as with any other form of excess, like gluttony.

If you can reflect well while you\u2019re in pain (which is probably too much to ask), great. But if you can remember to reflect after it passes, that\u2019s valuable too. (I created a Pain Button app to help people do this, which I describe in the appendix.)\n", "The challenges you face will test and strengthen you. If you\u2019re not failing, you\u2019re not pushing your limits, and if you\u2019re not pushing your limits, you\u2019re not maximizing your potential. Though this process of pushing your limits, of sometimes failing and sometimes breaking through\u2014and deriving benefits from both your failures and your successes\u2014is not for everyone, if it is for you, it can be so thrilling that it becomes addictive. Life will inevitably bring you such moments, and it\u2019ll be up to you to decide whether you want to go back for more.\n", "If you choose to push through this often painful process of personal evolution, you will naturally \u201cascend\u201d to higher and higher levels. As you climb above the blizzard of things that surrounds you, you will realize that they seem bigger than they really are when you are seeing them up close; that most things in life are just \u201canother one of those.\u201d The higher you ascend, the more effective you become at working with reality to shape outcomes toward your goals. What once seemed impossibly complex becomes simple.\n", "a. Go to the pain rather than avoid it. If you don\u2019t let up on yourself and instead become comfortable always operating with some level of pain, you will evolve at a faster pace. That\u2019s just the way it is.\n", "Every time you confront something painful, you are at a potentially important juncture in your life\u2014you have the opportunity to choose healthy and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion. The irony is that if you choose the healthy route, the pain will soon turn into pleasure. The pain is the signal! Like switching from not exercising to exercising, developing the habit of embracing the pain and learning from it will \u201cget you to the other side.\u201d\n", "By \u201cgetting to the other side,\u201d I mean that you will become hooked on:\n", "\u2022 Identifying, accepting, and learning how to deal with your weaknesses,\n", "\u2022 Preferring that the people around you be honest with you rather than keep their negative thoughts about you to themselves, and\n", "\u2022 Being yourself rather than having to pretend to be strong where you are weak.\n", "b. Embrace tough love. In my own life, what I want to give to people, most importantly to people I love, is the power to deal with reality to get what they want. In pursuit of my goal to give them strength, I will often deny them what they \u201cwant\u201d because that will give them the opportunity to struggle so that they can develop the strength to get what they want on their own. This can be difficult for people emotionally, even if they understand intellectually that having difficulties is the exercise they need to grow strong and that just giving them what they want will weaken them and ultimately lead to them needing more help.23\n", "Of course most people would prefer not to have weaknesses. Our upbringings and our experiences in the world have conditioned us to be embarrassed by our weaknesses and hide them. But people are happiest when they can be themselves. If you can be open with your weaknesses it will make you freer and will help you deal with them better. I urge you to not be embarrassed about your problems, recognizing that everyone has them. Bringing them to the surface will help you break your bad habits and develop good ones, and you will acquire real strengths and justifiable optimism.\n", "This evolutionary process of productive adaptation and ascent\u2014the process of seeking, obtaining, and pursuing more and more ambitious goals\u2014does not just pertain to how individuals and society move forward. It is equally relevant when dealing with setbacks, which are inevitable. At some point in your life you will crash in a big way. You might fail at your job or with your family, lose a loved one, suffer a serious accident or illness, or discover the life you imagined is out of reach forever. There are a whole host of ways that something will get you. At such times, you will be in pain and might think that you don\u2019t have the strength to go on. You almost always do, however; your ultimate success will depend on you realizing that fact, even though it might not seem that way at the moment.\n", "This is why many people who have endured setbacks that seemed devastating at the time ended up as happy as (or even happier than) they originally were after they successfully adapted to them. The quality of your life will depend on the choices you make at those painful moments. The faster one appropriately adapts, the better.24 No matter what you want out of life, your ability to adapt and move quickly and efficiently through the process of personal evolution will determine your success and your happiness.

This is because first-order consequences often have opposite desirabilities from second-order consequences, resulting in big mistakes in decision making. For example, the first-order consequences of exercise (pain and time spent) are commonly considered undesirable, while the second-order consequences (better health and more attractive appearance) are desirable. Similarly, food that tastes good is often bad for you and vice versa.\n", "Quite often the first-order consequences are the temptations that cost us what we really want, and sometimes they are the barriers that stand in our way. It\u2019s almost as though nature sorts us by throwing us trick choices that have both types of consequences and penalizing those who make their decisions on the basis of the first-order consequences alone.\n", "By contrast, people who choose what they really want, and avoid the temptations and get over the pains that drive them away from what they really want, are much more likely to have successful lives.\n"], "Own your outcomes.": ["Own your outcomes.\n", "For the most part, life gives you so many decisions to make and so many opportunities to recover from your mistakes that, if you handle them well, you can have a terrific life.

For example, a friend of mine dove into a swimming pool, hit his head, and became a quadriplegic. But he approached his situation well and became as happy as anybody else, because there are many paths to happiness.\n", "My point is simply this: Whatever circumstances life brings you, you will be more likely to succeed and find happiness if you take responsibility for making your decisions well instead of complaining about things being beyond your control. Psychologists call this having an \u201cinternal locus of control,\u201d and studies consistently show that people who have it outperform those who don\u2019t.\n", "So don\u2019t worry about whether you like your situation or not. Life doesn\u2019t give a damn about what you like. It\u2019s up to you to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it and then find the courage to carry it through.

I call this ability to rise above your own and others\u2019 circumstances and objectively look down on them \u201chigher-level thinking.\u201d Higher-level thinking gives you the ability to study and influence the cause-effect relationships at play in your life and use them to get the outcomes you want.\n", "a. Think of yourself as a machine operating within a machine and know that you have the ability to alter your machines to produce better outcomes. You have your goals. I call the way you will operate to achieve your goals your machine. It consists of a design (the things that have to get done) and the people (who will do the things that need getting done). Those people include you and those who help you. For example, imagine that your goal is a military one: to take a hill from an enemy. Your design for your \u201cmachine\u201d might include two scouts, two snipers, four infantrymen, and so on. While the right design is essential, it is only half the battle. It is equally important to put the right people in each of those positions. They need different qualities to do their jobs well\u2014the scouts must be fast runners, the snipers must be good marksmen\u2014so that the machine will produce the outcomes you seek.\n", "b. By comparing your outcomes with your goals, you can determine how to modify your machine. This evaluation and improvement process exactly mirrors the evolutionary process I described earlier. It means looking at how to improve or change the design or people to achieve your goals. Schematically, the process is a feedback loop, as shown in the diagram on the opposite page.\n", "c. Distinguish between you as the designer of your machine and you as a worker with your machine. One of the hardest things for people to do is to objectively look down on themselves within their circumstances (i.e., their machine) so that they can act as the machine\u2019s designer and manager. Most people remain stuck in the perspective of being a worker within the machine. If you can recognize the differences between those roles and that it is much more important that you are a good designer/manager of your life than a good worker in it, you will be on the right path. To be successful, the \u201cdesigner/manager you\u201d has to be objective about what the \u201cworker you\u201d is really like, not believing in him more than he deserves, or putting him in jobs he shouldn\u2019t be in. Instead of having this strategic perspective, most people operate emotionally and in the moment; their lives are a series of undirected emotional experiences, going from one thing to the next. If you want to look back on your life and feel you\u2019ve achieved what you wanted to, you can\u2019t operate that way.\n", "d. The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively, which leads them to bump into their own and others\u2019 weaknesses again and again. People who do this fail because they are stubbornly stuck in their own heads. If they could just get around this, they could live up to their potential.\n", "This is why higher-level thinking is essential for success.\n", "e. Successful people are those who can go above themselves to see things objectively and manage those things to shape change. They can take in the perspectives of others instead of being trapped in their own heads with their own biases. They are able to look objectively at what they are like\u2014their strengths and weaknesses\u2014and what others are like to put the right people in the right roles to achieve their goals. Once you understand how to do this you\u2019ll see that there\u2019s virtually nothing you can\u2019t accomplish. You will just have to learn how to face your realities and use the full range of resources at your disposal. For example, if you as the designer/manager discover that you as the worker can\u2019t do something well, you need to fire yourself as the worker and get a good replacement, while staying in the role of designer/manager of your own life. You shouldn\u2019t be upset if you find out that you\u2019re bad at something\u2014you should be happy that you found out, because knowing that and dealing with it will improve your chances of getting what you want.\n", "If you are disappointed because you can\u2019t be the best person to do everything yourself, you are terribly naive. Nobody can do everything well. Would you want to have Einstein on your basketball team? When he fails to dribble and shoot well, would you think badly of him? Should he feel humiliated? Imagine all the areas in which Einstein was incompetent, and imagine how hard he struggled to excel even in the areas in which he was the best in the world.\n", "Watching people struggle and having others watch you struggle can elicit all kinds of ego-driven emotions such as sympathy, pity, embarrassment, anger, or defensiveness. You need to get over all that and stop seeing struggling as something negative. Most of life\u2019s greatest opportunities come out of moments of struggle; it\u2019s up to you to make the most of these tests of creativity and character.\n", "When encountering your weaknesses you have four choices:\n", "1. You can deny them (which is what most people do).\n", "2. You can accept them and work at them in order to try to convert them into strengths (which might or might not work depending on your ability to change).\n", "3. You can accept your weaknesses and find ways around them.\n", "4. Or, you can change what you are going after.\n", "Which solution you choose will be critically important to the direction of your life. The worst path you can take is the first. Denial can only lead to your constantly banging up against your weaknesses, having pain, and not getting anywhere. The second\u2014accepting your weaknesses while trying to turn them into strengths\u2014is probably the best path if it works. But some things you will never be good at and it takes a lot of time and effort to change. The best single clue as to whether you should go down this path is whether the thing you are trying to do is consistent with your nature (i.e., your natural abilities). The third path\u2014accepting your weaknesses while trying to find ways around them\u2014is the easiest and typically the most viable path, yet it is the one least followed. The fourth path, changing what you are going after, is also a great path, though it requires flexibility on your part to get past your preconceptions and enjoy the good fit when you find it.\n", "f. Asking others who are strong in areas where you are weak to help you is a great skill that you should develop no matter what, as it will help you develop guardrails that will prevent you from doing what you shouldn\u2019t be doing. All successful people are good at this.\n", "g. Because it is difficult to see oneself objectively, you need to rely on the input of others and the whole body of evidence. I know that my own life has been full of mistakes and lots of great feedback. It was only by looking down on this body of evidence from a higher level that I was able to get around my mistakes and go after what I wanted. For as long as I have been practicing this, I still know I can\u2019t see myself objectively, which is why I continue to rely so much on the input of others.\n", "h. If you are open-minded enough and determined, you can get virtually anything you want. So I certainly don\u2019t want to dissuade you from going after whatever you want. At the same time, I urge you to reflect on whether what you are going after is consistent with your nature. Whatever your nature is, there are many paths that will suit you, so don\u2019t fixate on just one. Should a particular path close, all you have to do is find another good one consistent with what you\u2019re like.

Identify and don\u2019t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals.\n", "3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes.\n", "4. Design plans that will get you around them.\n", "5. Do what\u2019s necessary to push these designs through to results.\n", "Together, these five steps make up a loop, like the one on the facing page. Let\u2019s look at this process more granularly.\n", "First you have to pick what you are going after\u2014your goals. Your choice of goals will determine your direction. As you move toward them, you will encounter problems. Some of those problems will bring you up against your own weaknesses. How you react to the pain that causes is up to you. If you want to reach your goals, you must be calm and analytical so that you can accurately diagnose your problems, design a plan that will get you around them, and do what\u2019s necessary to push through to results. Then you will look at the new results you achieve and go through the process again. To evolve quickly, you will have to do this fast and continuously, setting your goals successively higher.\n", "You will need to do all five steps well to be successful and you must do them one at a time and in order. For example, when setting goals, just set goals. Don\u2019t think about how you will achieve them or what you will do if something goes wrong. When you are diagnosing problems, don\u2019t think about how you will solve them\u2014just diagnose them. Blurring the steps leads to suboptimal outcomes because it interferes with uncovering the true problems. The process is iterative: Doing each step thoroughly will provide you with the information you need to move on to the next step and do it well.\n", "It is essential that you approach this process in a clearheaded, rational way, looking down on yourself from a higher level and being ruthlessly honest. If your emotions are getting the better of you, step back and take time out until you can reflect clearly. If necessary, seek guidance from calm, thoughtful people.\n", "To help you stay centered and effective, pretend that your life is a martial art or a game, the object of which is to get around a challenge and reach a goal. Once you accept its rules, you\u2019ll get used to the discomfort that comes with the constant frustration. You will never handle everything perfectly: Mistakes are inevitable and it\u2019s impor-tant to recognize and accept this fact of life. The good news is that every mistake you make can teach you something, so there\u2019s no end to learning. You\u2019ll soon realize that excuses like \u201cthat\u2019s not easy\u201d or \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem fair\u201d or even \u201cI can\u2019t do that\u201d are of no value and that it pays to push through.\n", "So what if you don\u2019t have all the skills you need to succeed? Don\u2019t worry about it because that\u2019s true for everyone. You just have to know when they are needed and where you can go to get them. With practice, you will eventually play this game with a calm unstoppable centeredness in the face of adversity. Your ability to get what you want will thrill you.\n", "Now let\u2019s look at how to approach each of the five steps.\n"], "Have clear goals.": ["Have clear goals.\n", "a. Prioritize: While you can have virtually anything you want, you can\u2019t have everything you want. Life is like a giant smorgasbord with more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope to taste. Choosing a goal often means rejecting some things you want in order to get other things that you want or need even more. Some people fail at this point, before they\u2019ve even started. Afraid to reject a good alternative for a better one, they try to pursue too many goals at once, achieving few or none of them. Don\u2019t get discouraged and don\u2019t let yourself be paralyzed by all the choices. You can have much more than what you need to be happy. Make your choice and get on with it.\n", "b. Don\u2019t confuse goals with desires. A proper goal is something that you really need to achieve. Desires are things that you want that can prevent you from reaching your goals. Typically, desires are first-order consequences. For example, your goal might be physical fitness, while your desire is to eat good-tasting but unhealthy food. Don\u2019t get me wrong, if you want to be a couch potato, that\u2019s fine with me. You can pursue whatever goals you want. But if you don\u2019t want to be a couch potato, then you better not open that bag of chips.\n", "c. Decide what you really want in life by reconciling your goals and your desires. Take passion, for example. Without passion, life would be dull; you wouldn\u2019t want to live without it. But what\u2019s key is what you do with your passion. Do you let it consume you and drive you to irrational acts, or do you harness it to motivate and drive you while you pursue your real goals? What will ultimately fulfill you are things that feel right at both levels, as both desires and goals.\n", "d. Don\u2019t mistake the trappings of success for success itself. Achievement orientation is important, but people who obsess over a $1,200 pair of shoes or a fancy car are very rarely happy because they don\u2019t know what it is that they really want and hence what will satisfy them.\n", "e. Never rule out a goal because you think it\u2019s unattainable. Be audacious. There is always a best possible path. Your job is to find it and have the courage to follow it. What you think is attainable is just a function of what you know at the moment. Once you start your pursuit you will learn a lot, especially if you triangulate with others; paths you never saw before will emerge. Of course there are some impossibilities or near-impossibilities, such as playing center on a professional basketball team if you\u2019re short, or running a four-minute mile at age seventy.\n", "f. Remember that great expectations create great capabilities. If you limit your goals to what you know you can achieve, you are setting the bar way too low.\n", "g. Almost nothing can stop you from succeeding if you have a) flexibility and b) self-accountability. Flexibility is what allows you to accept what reality (or knowledgeable people) teaches you; self-accountability is essential because if you really believe that failing to achieve a goal is your personal failure, you will see your failing to achieve it as indicative that you haven\u2019t been creative or flexible or determined enough to do what it takes. And you will be that much more motivated to find the way.\n", "h. Knowing how to deal well with your setbacks is as important as knowing how to move forward. Sometimes you know that you are going over a waterfall and there is no way to avoid it. Life will throw you such challenges, some of which will seem devastating at the time. In bad times, your goal might be to keep what you have, to minimize your rate of loss, or simply to deal with a loss that is irrevocable.

Don\u2019t avoid confronting problems because they are rooted in harsh realities that are unpleasant to look at. Thinking about problems that are difficult to solve may make you anxious, but not thinking about them (and hence not dealing with them) should make you more anxious still. When a problem stems from your own lack of talent or skill, most people feel shame. Get over it. I cannot emphasize this enough: Acknowledging your weaknesses is not the same as surrendering to them. It\u2019s the first step toward overcoming them. The pains you are feeling are \u201cgrowing pains\u201d that will test your character and reward you as you push through them.\n", "c. Be specific in identifying your problems. You need to be precise, because different problems have different solutions. If a problem is due to inadequate skill, additional training may be called for; if it arises from an innate weakness, you may need to seek assistance from someone else or change the role you play. In other words, if you\u2019re bad at accounting, hire an accountant. If a problem stems from someone else\u2019s weaknesses, replace them with someone who is strong where it\u2019s needed.

Don\u2019t mistake a cause of a problem with the real problem. \u201cI can\u2019t get enough sleep\u201d is not a problem; it is a potential cause (or perhaps the result) of a problem. To clarify your thinking, try to identify the bad outcome first; e.g., \u201cI am performing poorly in my job.\u201d Not sleeping enough may be the cause of that problem, or the cause may be something else\u2014but in order to determine that, you need to know exactly what the problem is.\n", "e. Distinguish big problems from small ones. You only have so much time and energy; make sure you are investing them in exploring the problems that, if fixed, will yield you the biggest returns.

Strategic thinking requires both diagnosis and design. A good diagnosis typically takes between fifteen minutes and an hour, depending on how well it\u2019s done and how complex the issue is. It involves speaking with the relevant people and looking at the evidence together to determine the root causes. Like principles, root causes manifest themselves over and over again in seemingly different situations. Finding them and dealing with them pays dividends again and again.\n", "b. Distinguish proximate causes from root causes. Proximate causes are typically the actions (or lack of actions) that lead to problems, so they are described with verbs (I missed the train because I didn\u2019t check the train schedule). Root causes run much deeper and they are typically described with adjectives (I didn\u2019t check the train schedule because I am forgetful). You can only truly solve your problems by removing their root causes, and to do that, you must distinguish the symptoms from the disease.\n", "c. Recognize that knowing what someone (including you) is like will tell you what you can expect from them. You will have to get over your reluctance to assess what people are like if you want to surround yourself with people who have the qualities you need. That goes for yourself too. People almost always find it difficult to identify and accept their own mistakes and weaknesses. Sometimes it\u2019s because they\u2019re blind to them, but more often it\u2019s because their egos get in the way. Most likely your associates are equally reluctant to point out your mistakes, because they don\u2019t want to hurt you. You all need to get over this.

Understand your ego barrier. When I refer to your \u201cego barrier,\u201d I\u2019m referring to your subliminal defense mechanisms that make it hard for you to accept your mistakes and weaknesses. Your deepest-seated needs and fears\u2014such as the need to be loved and the fear of losing love, the need to survive and the fear of not surviving, the need to be important and the fear of not mattering\u2014reside in primitive parts of your brain such as the amygdala, which are structures in your temporal lobe that process emotions. Because these areas of your brain are not accessible to your conscious awareness, it is virtually impossible for you to understand what they want and how they control you. They oversimplify things and react instinctively. They crave praise and respond to criticism as an attack, even when the higher-level parts of the brain understand that constructive criticism is good for you. They make you defensive, especially when it comes to the subject of how good you are.\n", "At the same time, higher-level consciousness resides in your neocortex, more specifically in the part called the prefrontal cortex. This is the most distinctively human feature of your brain; relative to the rest of the brain, it\u2019s larger in humans than in most other species.

When you try to explain your behavior, your explanations don\u2019t make any sense. That\u2019s because your lower-level you is trying to speak through your upper-level you.

In addition to your ego barrier, you (and everyone else) also have blind spots\u2014areas where your way of thinking prevents you from seeing things accurately. Just as we all have different ranges for hearing pitch and seeing colors, we have different ranges for seeing and understanding things. We each see things in our own way.

As a result, they continually run toward what they see and keep crashing into what they are blind to until the crashing leads them to adapt. Those who adapt do so by a) teaching their brains to work in a way that doesn\u2019t come naturally (the creative person learns to become organized through discipline and practice, for instance), b) using compensating mechanisms (such as programmed reminders), and/or c) relying on the help of others who are strong where they are weak.\n", "Differences in thinking can be symbiotic and complementary instead of disruptive.

Not only does this view not square with reality, it stands in the way of their progress. People interested in making the best possible decisions are rarely confident that they have the best answers.

You should be what I call open-minded and assertive at the same time\u2014you should hold and explore conflicting possibilities in your mind while moving fluidly toward whatever is likely to be true based on what you learn. Some people can do this easily while others can\u2019t. A good exercise to make sure that you are doing this well is to describe back to the person you are disagreeing with their own perspective. If they agree that you\u2019ve got it, then you\u2019re in good shape.

I know it has made the difference between life and death for me. In June 2013, I went to Johns Hopkins for an annual physical, where I was told that I had a precancerous condition called Barrett\u2019s esophagus with high-grade dysplasia. Dysplasia is an early stage in the development of cancer, and the probability that it will turn into esophageal cancer is relatively high\u2014about 15 percent of cases per year. Cancer of the esophagus is deadly, so if left untreated, the odds were that in something like three to five years I\u2019d develop cancer and die. The standard protocol for cases like mine is to remove the esophagus, but I wasn\u2019t a candidate for that because of something specific to my condition. The doctor advised that I wait and see how things progressed.\n", "In the weeks that followed, I started to plan for my eventual death, while also fighting to live. I like to:\n", "a.

So I also had my personal physician, Dr. Glazer, set up visits with four other experts on this particular disease.\n", "The first call was with the head of thoracic surgery at a major cancer hospital. She explained that my condition had advanced quickly and that, contrary to what the first physician said, there was a surgery that could cure me. It would involve removing both my esophagus and my stomach and attaching my intestines to the remaining little bit of my esophagus I\u2019d have left. She estimated I\u2019d have a 10 percent chance of dying on the operating table and a 70 percent chance of a crippling outcome. But the odds were in favor of my living, so her recommendation was clearly worth taking seriously. Naturally I wanted her to speak with the doctor from Johns Hopkins who originally diagnosed me and recommended a watch-and-wait approach, so right then and there I called the other doctor to see what each would say about the other\u2019s views. This was eye-opening. While the two doctors had told me completely different things when I met with them in person, when they were on the phone together, they sought to minimize their disagreement and make the other look good, putting professional courtesy ahead of thrashing things out to get at the best answer. Still, the differences in their views were clear, and listening to them deepened my understanding.\n", "The next day I met with a third doctor who was a world-renowned specialist and researcher at another esteemed hospital. He told me that my condition would basically cause me no problems so long as I came in for an endoscopic examination every three months. He explained that it was like skin cancer but on the inside\u2014if it was watched and any new growth was clipped before it metastasized into the bloodstream, I\u2019d be okay. According to him, the results for patients monitored in this way were no different than for those who had their esophagus removed. To put that plainly: They didn\u2019t die from cancer. Life went on as normal for them except for those occasional examinations and procedures.\n", "To recap: Over the course of forty-eight hours, I had gone from a likely death sentence to a likely cure that would essentially involve disemboweling me, and then finally to a simple, and only slightly inconvenient, way of watching for abnormalities and removing them before they could cause any harm.

During the procedure, they clipped some tissue from my esophagus and sent it to the laboratory for testing.

To practice open-mindedness:\n", "a. Regularly use pain as your guide toward quality reflection. Mental pain often comes from being too attached to an idea when a person or an event comes along to challenge it. This is especially true when what is being pointed out to you involves a weakness on your part. This kind of mental pain is a clue that you are potentially wrong and that you need to think about the question in a quality way. To do this, first calm yourself down. This can be difficult: You will probably feel your amygdala kicking in through a tightening in your head, tension in your body, or an emerging sense of annoyance, anger, or irritability. Note these feelings when they arise in you. By being aware of such signals of closed-mindedness, you can use them as cues to control your behavior and guide yourself toward open-mindedness. Doing this regularly will strengthen your ability to keep your \u201chigher-level you\u201d in control. The more you do it, the stronger you will become.\n", "b. Make being open-minded a habit. The life that you will live is most simply the result of habits you develop. If you consistently use feelings of anger/frustration as cues to calm down, slow down, and approach the subject at hand thoughtfully, over time you\u2019ll experience negative emotions much less frequently and go directly to the open-minded practices I just described.\n", "Of course, this can be very hard for people to do in the moment because your \u201clower-level you\u201d emotions are so powerful. The good news is that these \u201camygdala hijackings\u201d27 don\u2019t last long so even if you\u2019re having trouble controlling yourself in the moment, you can also allow a little time to pass to give your higher-level you space to reflect in a quality way. Have others whom you respect help you too.\n", "c. Get to know your blind spots. When you are closed-minded and form an opinion in an area where you have a blind spot, it can be deadly. So take some time to record the circumstances in which you\u2019ve consistently made bad decisions because you failed to see what others saw. Ask others\u2014especially those who\u2019ve seen what you\u2019ve missed\u2014to help you with this. Write a list, tack it up on the wall, and stare at it. If ever you find yourself about to make a decision (especially a big decision) in one of these areas without consulting others, understand that you\u2019re taking a big risk and that it would be illogical to expect that you\u2019ll get the results you think you will.\n", "d. If a number of different believable people say you are doing something wrong and you are the only one who doesn\u2019t see it that way, assume that you are probably biased. Be objective! While it is possible that you are right and they are wrong, you should switch from a fighting mode to an \u201casking questions\u201d mode, compare your believability with theirs, and if necessary agree to bring in a neutral party you all respect to break the deadlock.\n", "e.

Instead, they make their decisions based on what their deep-seated subconscious mind wants and then they filter the evidence to make it consistent with those desires. It is possible to become aware of this subconscious process happening and to catch yourself, or to allow others to catch you going down this path. When you\u2019re approaching a decision, ask yourself: Can you point to clear facts (i.e., facts believable people wouldn\u2019t dispute) leading to your view?

This can be extremely difficult. But it\u2019s smarter and ultimately better for you to be open-minded and have faith that the consensus of believable others is better than whatever you think. If you can\u2019t understand their view, you\u2019re probably just blind to their way of thinking. If you continue doing what you think is best when all the evidence and believable people are against you, you\u2019re being dangerously arrogant.\n", "The truth is that while most people can become radically open-minded, some can\u2019t, even after they have repeatedly encountered lots of pain from betting that they were right when they were not.28 People who don\u2019t learn radical open-mindedness don\u2019t experience the metamorphosis that allows them to do much better. I myself had to have that humility beaten into me by my crashes, especially my big one in 1982. Gaining open-mindedness doesn\u2019t mean losing assertiveness. In fact, because it increases one\u2019s odds of being right, it should increase one\u2019s confidence.

But I had a hard time finding those sorts of people and even when I did, I was shocked at how differently their brains seemed to work. It was as though we were speaking different languages. For example, those who were \u201cconceptual\u201d and imprecise spoke one language while those who were literal and precise spoke another. At the time, we chalked this up to \u201ccommunication problems,\u201d but the differences were much deeper than that\u2014and they were painful for all of us, particularly when we were trying to achieve big things together.\n", "I remember one research project\u2014an ambitious attempt to systemize our global understanding of the bond markets\u2014that took place years ago. Bob Prince was running it, and while we agreed conceptually on what we were trying to do, the project didn\u2019t get pushed through to results. We\u2019d meet with Bob and his team to agree on the goal and lay out how to get there. But when they\u2019d go off to work on it, they\u2019d make no progress. The problem was that conceptual people who visualized what should be done in vague ways expected more literal people to figure out for themselves how to do it. When they didn\u2019t, the more conceptual people thought the more literal people had no imagination, and the more literal people thought the more conceptual people had their heads in the clouds. To make matters worse, none of them knew which were which\u2014the more literal people thought that they were as conceptual as the conceptual people and vice versa. In short, we were gridlocked, and everyone thought it was someone else\u2019s fault\u2014that the people they were locking horns with were blind, stubborn, or just plain stupid.\n", "Those meetings were painful for everyone. Because no one was clear about what they were good or bad at, everybody expressed opinions about everything and there wasn\u2019t any sensible way of sorting through them. We discussed why the group was failing, which led us to see that the individuals Bob had chosen for his team reflected his own strengths and weaknesses in their own roles. While that took frankness and open-mindedness and was a big step forward, it wasn\u2019t recorded and systematically converted into adequate changes, so the same people kept making the same sort of mistakes, over and over again.\n", "Isn\u2019t it obvious that our different ways of thinking, our emotional responses, and our not having ways of dealing with them is crippling us?

I found the results remarkable, because she not only confirmed my own observations of the ways that their minds were working at the time but also predicted how they would develop in the future. For example, one of my kids was struggling with arithmetic. Because he tested well in mathematical reasoning, she correctly told him that if he pushed through the boredom of rote memorization required in elementary school, he would love the higher-level concepts he would be exposed to when he got older. These insights opened my eyes to new possibilities. I turned to her and others years later when I was trying to figure out the different thinking styles of my employees and colleagues.\n", "At first, the experts gave me both bad and good advice. Many seemed as if they were more interested in making people feel good (or not feel bad) than they were at getting at the truth. Even more startling, I found that most psychologists didn\u2019t know much about neuroscience and most neuroscientists didn\u2019t know much about psychology\u2014and both were reluctant to connect the physiological differences in people\u2019s brains to the differences in their aptitudes and behaviors. But eventually I found Dr. Bob Eichinger, who opened the world of psychometric testing to me.

Just as our physical attributes determine the limits of what we are able to do physically\u2014some people are tall and others are short, some muscular and others weak\u2014our brains are innately different in ways that set the parameters of what we are able to do mentally. As with our bodies, some parts of our brains cannot be materially affected by external experience (in the same way that your skeleton isn\u2019t changed much through working out), while other parts can be strengthened through exercise (I will have more to say about brain plasticity later in this chapter).\n", "This was driven home to me by my son Paul\u2019s three-year struggle with bipolar disorder. As terrifying and frustrating as his behavior was, I came to realize that it was due to his brain\u2019s chemistry (specifically, its secreting serotonin and dopamine in spurts and sputters). As I went through that terrible journey with him, I experienced the frustration and anger of trying to reason with someone who wasn\u2019t thinking well. I constantly had to remind myself that there was no basis for my anger because his distorted logic was a product of his physiology\u2014and I saw for myself how the doctors who approached it that way brought him to a state of crystal clarity. The experience not only taught me a lot about how brains work but why creative genius often exists at the edge of insanity. Many highly productive and creative people have suffered from bipolar disorder, among them Ernest Hemingway, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Vincent van Gogh, Jackson Pollock, Virginia Woolf, Winston Churchill, and the psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison (who has written frankly about her own experiences with the disease in her book An Unquiet Mind). I learned that we are all different because of the different ways that the machine that is our brain works\u2014and that nearly one in five Americans are clinically mentally ill in one way or another.\n", "Once I understood that it\u2019s all physiological, many things became clearer to me. While I used to get angry and frustrated at people because of the choices they made, I came to realize that they weren\u2019t intentionally acting in a way that seemed counterproductive; they were just living out things as they saw them, based on how their brains worked. I also realized that as off-base as they seemed to me, they saw me the same way. The only sensible way of behaving with each other was to look down upon ourselves with mutual understanding so we could make objective sense of things. Not only did this make our disagreements less frustrating, it also allowed us to maximize our effectiveness.\n", "Everyone is like a Lego set of attributes, with each piece reflecting the workings of a different part of their brain.

We are born with attributes that can both help us and hurt us, depending on their application. Most attributes are a double-edged sword that bring potential benefits and potential harm. The more extreme the attribute, the more extreme the potential good or bad outcomes it is likely to produce. For example, a highly creative, goal-oriented person good at imagining new ideas might undervalue the minutiae of daily life, which is also important; he might be so driven in his pursuit of long-term goals that he might have disdain for people who focus on the details of daily life. Similarly, a task-oriented person who is great with details might undervalue creativity\u2014and worse still, may squelch it in the interests of efficiency. These two people might make a great team, but are likely to have trouble taking advantage of the ways they\u2019re complementary, because the ways their minds work make it difficult for them to see the value of each other\u2019s ways of thinking.\n", "Having expectations for people (including yourself) without knowing what they are like is a sure way to get in trouble. I learned this the hard way, through years of frustrating conversations and the pain of expecting things from people who were constitutionally incapable of delivering them. I\u2019m sure that I caused them plenty of pain too. Over time, I realized that I needed a systematic approach to capturing and recording our differences so that we could actively take them into consideration when putting people into different roles at Bridgewater.\n", "This led to one of my most valuable management tools: Baseball Cards, which I mentioned in the first part of this book. Just as a baseball card compiles the relevant data on a baseball player, helping fans know what that player is good and bad at, I decided that it would be similarly helpful for us to have cards for all of our players at Bridgewater.\n", "In creating the attributes for our baseball cards, I used a combination of adjectives we already used to describe people, like \u201cconceptual,\u201d \u201creliable,\u201d \u201ccreative,\u201d and \u201cdetermined\u201d; the actions people took or didn\u2019t take such as \u201cholding others accountable\u201d and \u201cpushing through to results\u201d; and terms from personality tests such as \u201cextroverted\u201d or \u201cjudging.\u201d Once the cards were established, I created a process to have people evaluate each other, with the people rated highest in each dimension (e.g., \u201cmost creative\u201d) having more weight on the ratings of other people in that dimension. People with proven track records in a certain area would get more believability, or decision-making weight, within that area. By recording these qualities in people\u2019s Baseball Cards, others who\u2019d never worked with them before could know what to expect from them. When people changed, their rating would change. And when they didn\u2019t change, we were even more sure of what we could expect of them.\n", "Naturally when I introduced this tool, people were skeptical or scared of it for various reasons. Some were afraid that the cards would be inaccurate; others thought it would be uncomfortable to have their weaknesses made so apparent, or that it would lead to their being pigeonholed, inhibiting their growth; still others thought it would be too complex to be practical. Imagine how you would feel if you were asked to force-rank all your colleagues on creativity, determination, or reliability. Most people at first find that prospect frightening.\n", "Still, I knew that we needed to be radically open in recording and considering what people were like, and that things would eventually evolve to address people\u2019s concerns if we were sensible about how we approached the process. Today, most everyone at Bridgewater finds these Baseball Cards to be essential, and we have built a whole suite of other tools, which will be further described in Work Principles, to support our drive to understand what people are like and who is believable at what.\n", "I\u2019ve already noted that our unique way of operating and the treasure trove of data we accumulated brought us to the attention of some world-renowned organizational psychologists and researchers. Bob Kegan of Harvard University, Adam Grant of the Wharton School, and Ed Hess of the University of Virginia have written about us extensively, and I have learned a great deal from them in turn. In a way I never intended, our trial-and-error discovery process has put us at the cutting edge of academic thinking about personal development within organizations. As Kegan wrote in his book An Everyone Culture, \u201cfrom the individual experience of probing in every one-on-one meeting, to the technologically integrated processes for discussing . . . issues and baseball cards, to the company-wide practices of daily updates and cases, Bridgewater has built an ecosystem to support personal development. The system helps everyone in the company confront the truth about what everyone is like.\u201d\n", "Our journey of discovery has coincided with an incredibly fertile epoch in neuroscience, when, thanks to rapid advances in brain imaging and the ability to gather and process big data, our understanding has accelerated dramatically. As with all sciences on the cusp of breakthroughs, I am sure that much of what is thought to be true today will soon be radically improved. But what I do know is how incredibly beautiful and useful it is to understand how the thinking machine between our ears works.\n", "Here\u2019s some of what I\u2019ve learned:\n", "The brain is even more complex than we can imagine. It has an estimated eighty-nine billion tiny computers (called neurons) that are connected to each other through many trillions of \u201cwires\u201d called axons and chemical synapses. As David Eagleman describes it in his wonderful book Incognito:\n", "Your brain is built of cells called neurons and glia\u2014hundreds of billions of them. Each one of them is as complex as a city. . . . The cells [neurons] are connected in a network of such staggering complexity that it bankrupts human language and necessitates new strains of mathematics. A typical neuron makes about ten thousand connections to neighboring neurons. Given billions of neurons, this means that there are as many connections in a single cubic centimeter of brain tissue as there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy.\n", "When we are born our brains are preprogrammed with learning accumulated over hundreds of millions of years. For example, researchers at the University of Virginia have shown that while many people have an instinctual fear of snakes, no one has an instinctual fear of flowers. The brains that we were born with had learned that snakes are dangerous and flowers are not. There\u2019s a reason for that.\n", "There is one grand design for the brains of all mammals, fish, birds, amphibians, and reptiles, which was established nearly 300 million years ago and has been evolving ever since. Just as cars have evolved into different versions\u2014sedans, SUVs, sports cars, etc.\u2014that rely on many of the same underlying parts, all vertebrate brains have similar parts that do similar things but that are well adapted to the needs of their own particular species. For example, birds have superior occipital lobes because they need to spot prey (and predators) from great heights. While we humans think of ourselves as superior overall because we overemphasize the importance of our own advantages, other species could justifiably make the same claims on their own behalf\u2014birds for flight, eyesight, and instinctual magnetic navigation; most animals for smell; and several for appearing to have particularly enjoyable sex.\n", "This \u201cuniversal brain\u201d has evolved from the bottom up, meaning that its lower parts are evolutionarily the oldest and the top parts are the newest. The brainstem controls the subconscious processes that keep us and other species alive\u2014heartbeat, breathing, nervous system, and our degree of arousal and alertness. The next layer up, the cerebellum, gives us the ability to control our limb movements by coordinating sensory input with our muscles. Then comes the cerebrum, which includes the basal ganglia (which controls habit) and other parts of the limbic system (which controls emotional responses and some movement) and the cerebral cortex (which is where our memories, thoughts, and sense of consciousness reside). The newest and most advanced part of the cortex, that wrinkled mass of gray matter that looks like a bunch of intestines, is called the neocortex, which is where learning, planning, imagination, and other higher-level thoughts come from. It accounts for a significantly higher ratio of the brain\u2019s gray matter than is found in the brains of other species.\n"], "Meaningful work and meaningful relationships aren\u2019t just nice things we chose for ourselves\u2014they are genetically programmed into us.": ["Meaningful work and meaningful relationships aren\u2019t just nice things we chose for ourselves\u2014they are genetically programmed into us.\n", "Neuroscientists, psychologists, and evolutionists agree the human brain comes pre-programmed with the need for and enjoyment of social cooperation. Our brains want it and develop better when we have it. The meaningful relationships we get from social cooperation make us happier, healthier, and more productive; social cooperation is also integral to effective work. It is one of the defining characteristics of being human.29\n", "Leonard Mlodinow, in his excellent book Subliminal, writes, \u201cWe usually assume that what distinguishes us [from other species] is IQ. But it is our social IQ that ought to be the principal quality that differentiates us.\u201d He points out that humans have a unique ability to understand what other people are like and how they are likely to behave. The brain comes programmed to develop this ability; by the time they are four years old, most children are able to read others\u2019 mental states. This sort of human understanding and cooperation is what makes us so accomplished as a species. As Mlodinow explains, \u201cBuilding a car for example requires the participation of thousands of people with diverse skills, in diverse lands, performing diverse tasks. Metals like iron must be extracted from the ground and processed; glass, rubber, and plastics must be created from numerous chemical precursors and molded; batteries, radiators and countless other parts must be produced; electronic and mechanical systems must be designed; and it all must come together, coordinated from far and wide, in one factory so that the car can be assembled. Today, even the coffee and bagel you might consume while driving to work in the morning is the result of the activities of people all over the world.\u201d\n", "In his book The Meaning of Human Existence, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author Edward O. Wilson surmises that between one million and two million years ago, when our ancestors were somewhere between chimpanzees and modern homo sapiens, the brain evolved in ways supporting cooperation so man could hunt and do other activities. This led the centers of memory and reasoning in the prefrontal cortex to develop beyond those of our primate relatives. As groups became more powerful than individuals and our brains evolved in ways that made larger groups manageable, competition between groups became more important than competition between individuals and groups that had more cooperative individuals did better than those without them. This evolution led to the development of altruism, morality, and the sense of conscience and honor. Wilson explains that man is perpetually suspended between the two extreme forces that created us: \u201cIndividual selection [which] prompted sin and group selection [which] promoted virtue.\u201d\n", "Which of these forces (self-interest or collective interest) wins out in any organization is a function of that organization\u2019s culture, which is a function of the people who shape it. But it\u2019s clear that collective interest is what\u2019s best, not just for the organization but for the individuals who make it up. As I\u2019ll explain in Work Principles, the rewards of working together to make the pie bigger are greater than the rewards of self-interest, not only in terms of how much \u201cpie\u201d one gets but also in the psychic rewards wired into our brains that make us happier and healthier.\n", "Knowing how the brain has evolved thus far, we might extrapolate the past into the future to imagine where it will go. Clearly the evolution of the brain has moved from being nonthinking and self-focused toward being more abstract and more universally focused. For example, the brain evolution that I described has given us (some people more than others) the ability to see ourselves and our circumstances from a higher holistic level and, in some cases, to value the whole that we are part of even more than ourselves.\n", "A few years ago, I had a conversation with the Dalai Lama in which I explained to him the contemporary neuroscience view that all of our thinking and feeling is due to physiology (in other words, the chemicals, electricity, and biology in our brains working like a machine). This implied that spirituality is due to these physiological mechanics rather than something coming from above, so I asked him what he thought about that. Without hesitation, he responded \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d and told me that the next day he was meeting with the University of Wisconsin professor of neuroscience who had helped him learn about this, and he asked me if I wanted to join him. Regrettably, I couldn\u2019t but I recommended to him a book I\u2019d read on the subject called The Spiritual Brain (which I also recommend to you). In our conversation, we went on to discuss the similarities and differences between spirituality and religion. His view was that prayer and meditation seemed to have similar effects on the brain in producing feelings of spirituality (the rising above oneself to feel a greater connection to the whole) but that each religion adds its own different superstitions on top of that common feeling of spirituality. Rather than trying to squeeze my own summary of his thinking in here, I\u2019ll simply recommend the Dalai Lama\u2019s book, Beyond Religion, if you\u2019re interested in learning more.\n", "In imagining what the future of our thinking will be like, it\u2019s also interesting to consider how man himself might change how the brain works. We are certainly doing that with drugs and technology. Given advances in genetic engineering, it\u2019s reasonable to expect that someday genetic engineers might mix and match features of different species\u2019 brains for different purposes\u2014if you want to have a heightened sense of sight, say, genetic engineers might be able to manipulate the human brain so it grows optic lobes more like those of birds. But since such things won\u2019t happen anytime soon, let\u2019s get back to the practical question of how all this can help us better deal with ourselves and each other.\n"], "Understand the great brain battles and how to control them to get what \u201cyou\u201d want.": ["Understand the great brain battles and how to control them to get what \u201cyou\u201d want.\n", "The following sections explore the different ways your brain fights for control of \u201cyou.\u201d While I will refer to the specific parts of the brain that neurophysiologists believe are responsible for specific types of thinking and emotions, the actual physiology is much more complex\u2014and scientists are only beginning to understand it.\n", "a. Realize that the conscious mind is in a battle with the subconscious mind. Earlier in the book, I introduced the concept of the \u201ctwo yous\u201d and explained how your higher-level you can look down on your lower-level you to make sure that your lower-level you isn\u2019t sabotaging what your higher-level you wants. Though I\u2019ve often seen these two yous in action in myself and others, it wasn\u2019t until I learned why they exist that I really understood them.\n", "As with animals, many of our decision-making drivers are below the surface. An animal doesn\u2019t \u201cdecide\u201d to fly or hunt or sleep or fight in the way that we go about making many of our own choices of what to do\u2014it simply follows the instructions that come from the subconscious parts of its brain. These same sorts of instructions come to us from the same parts of our brains, sometimes for good evolutionary reasons and sometimes to our detriment. Our subconscious fears and desires drive our motivations and actions through emotions such as love, fear, and inspiration. It\u2019s physiological. Love, for example, is a cocktail of chemicals (such as oxytocin) secreted by the pituitary gland.\n", "While I had always assumed that logical conversation is the best way for people to get at what is true, armed with this new knowledge about the brain, I came to understand that there are large parts of our brains that don\u2019t do what is logical. For example, I learned that when people refer to their \u201cfeelings\u201d\u2014such as saying \u201cI feel that you were unfair with me\u201d\u2014they are typically referring to messages that originate in the emotional, subconscious parts of their brains. I also came to understand that while some subconscious parts of our brains are dangerously animalistic, others are smarter and quicker than our conscious minds. Our greatest moments of inspiration often \u201cpop\u201d up from our subconscious. We experience these creative breakthroughs when we are relaxed and not trying to access the part of the brain in which they reside, which is generally the neocortex. When you say, \u201cI just thought of something,\u201d you noticed your subconscious mind telling your conscious mind something. With training, it\u2019s possible to open this stream of communication.\n", "Many people only see the conscious mind and aren\u2019t aware of the benefits of connecting it to the subconscious. They believe that the way to accomplish more is to cram more into the conscious mind and make it work harder, but this is often counterproductive. While it may seem counterintuitive, clearing your head can be the best way to make progress.\n", "Knowing this, I now understand why creativity comes to me when I relax (like when I\u2019m in the shower) and how meditation helps open this connection. Because it is physiological, I can actually feel the creative thoughts coming from elsewhere and flowing into my conscious mind. It\u2019s a kick to understand how that works.\n", "But a note of caution is in order too: When thoughts and instructions come to me from my subconscious, rather than acting on them immediately, I have gotten into the habit of examining them with my conscious, logical mind. I have found that in addition to helping me figure out which thoughts are valid and why I am reacting to them as I do, doing this opens further communication between my conscious and subconscious minds. It\u2019s helpful to write down the results of this process. In fact that\u2019s how my Principles came about.\n", "If you take nothing else away from this chapter, be aware of your subconscious\u2014of how it can both harm you and help you, and how by consciously reflecting on what comes out of it, perhaps with the help of others, you can become happier and more effective.\n", "b. Know that the most constant struggle is between feeling and thinking. There are no greater battles than those between our feelings (most importantly controlled by our amygdala, which operates subconsciously) and our rational thinking (most importantly controlled by our prefrontal cortex, which operates consciously). If you understand how those battles occur you will understand why it is so important to reconcile what you get from your subconscious with what you get from your conscious mind.\n", "That damned amygdala, which is a little almond-shaped structure that lies deeply embedded in the cerebrum, is one of the most powerful parts of your brain. It controls your behavior, even though you\u2019re not conscious of it. How does it work? When something upsets us\u2014and that something could be a sound, a sight, or just a gut feeling\u2014the amygdala sends notice to our bodies to prepare to fight or flee: the heartbeat speeds up, the blood pressure rises, and breathing quickens. During an argument, you\u2019ll often notice a physical response similar to how you react to fear (for instance, rapid heartbeats and tensing muscles). Recognizing that, your conscious mind (which resides in the prefrontal cortex) can refuse to obey its instructions. Typically, these amygdala hijackings come on fast and dissipate quickly, except in rare cases, such as when a person develops post-traumatic stress disorder from a particularly horrible event or series of events. Knowing how these hijackings work, you know that if you allow yourself to react spontaneously, you will be prone to overreact. You can also comfort yourself with the knowledge that whatever psychological pain you are experiencing will go away before very long.\n", "c. Reconcile your feelings and your thinking. For most people, life is a never-ending battle between these two parts of the brain. While the amygdala\u2019s reactions come in spurts and then subside, reactions from the prefrontal cortex are more gradual and constant. The biggest difference between people who guide their own personal evolution and achieve their goals and those who don\u2019t is that those who make progress reflect on what causes their amygdala hijackings.\n", "d. Choose your habits well. Habit is probably the most powerful tool in your brain\u2019s toolbox. It is driven by a golf-ball-sized lump of tissue called the basal ganglia at the base of the cerebrum. It is so deep-seated and instinctual that we are not conscious of it, though it controls our actions.\n", "If you do just about anything frequently enough over time, you will form a habit that will control you. Good habits are those that get you to do what your \u201cupper-level you\u201d wants, and bad habits are those that are controlled by your \u201clower-level you\u201d and stand in the way of your getting what your \u201cupper-level you\u201d wants. You can create a better set of habits if you understand how this part of your brain works. For example, you can develop a habit that will make you \u201cneed\u201d to work out at the gym.\n", "Developing this skill takes some work. The first step is recognizing how habits develop in the first place. Habit is essentially inertia, the strong tendency to keep doing what you have been doing (or not doing what you have not been doing). Research suggests that if you stick with a behavior for approximately eighteen months, you will build a strong tendency to stick to it nearly forever.\n", "For a long time, I didn\u2019t appreciate the extent to which habits control people\u2019s behavior. I experienced this at Bridgewater in the form of people who agreed with our work principles in the abstract but had trouble living by them; I also observed it with friends and family members who wanted to achieve something but constantly found themselves working against their own best interests.\n", "Then I read Charles Duhigg\u2019s best-selling book The Power of Habit, which really opened my eyes. I recommend that you read it yourself if your interest in this subject goes deeper than what I\u2019m able to cover here. Duhigg\u2019s core idea is the role of the three-step \u201chabit loop.\u201d The first step is a cue\u2014some \u201ctrigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use,\u201d according to Duhigg. Step two is the routine, \u201cwhich can be physical or mental or emotional.\u201d Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is \u201cworth remembering for the future.\u201d Repetition reinforces this loop until over time it becomes automatic. This anticipation and craving is the key to what animal trainers call operant conditioning, which is a method of training that uses positive reinforcement. For example, dog trainers use a sound (typically a clicker) to reinforce behavior by pairing that sound with a more desirable reward (typically food) until the dog will perform the desired behavior when it merely hears the click. In humans, Duhigg says, rewards can be just about anything, ranging \u201cfrom food or drugs that cause physical sensations, to emotional payoffs, such as the feelings of pride that accompany praise or self-congratulation.\u201d\n", "Habits put your brain on \u201cautomatic pilot.\u201d In neuroscientific terms, the basal ganglia takes over from your cortex, so that you can execute activities without even thinking about them.\n", "Reading Duhigg\u2019s book taught me that if you really want to change, the best thing you can do is choose which habits to acquire and which to get rid of and then go about doing that. To help you, I recommend that you write down your three most harmful habits. Do that right now. Now pick one of those habits and be committed to breaking it. Can you do that? That would be extraordinarily impactful. If you break all three, you will radically improve the trajectory of your life. Or you can pick habits that you want to acquire and then acquire them.\n", "The most valuable habit I\u2019ve acquired is using pain to trigger quality reflections. If you can acquire this habit yourself, you will learn what causes your pain and what you can do about it, and it will have an enormous impact on your effectiveness.\n", "e. Train your \u201clower-level you\u201d with kindness and persistence to build the right habits. I used to think that the upper-level you needed to fight with the lower-level you to gain control, but over time I\u2019ve learned that it is more effective to train that subconscious, emotional you the same way you would teach a child to behave the way you would like him or her to behave\u2014with loving kindness and persistence so that the right habits are acquired.\n", "f. Understand the differences between right-brained and left-brained thinking. Just as your brain has its conscious upper part and its subconscious lower part, it also has two halves called hemispheres.30 You might have heard it said that some people are more left-brained while others are more right-brained. That\u2019s not just a saying\u2014Caltech professor Roger Sperry won the Nobel Prize in medicine for discovering it. In a nutshell:\n", "1. The left hemisphere reasons sequentially, analyzes details, and excels at linear analysis. \u201cLeft-brained\u201d or \u201clinear\u201d thinkers who are analytically strong are often called \u201cbright.\u201d\n", "2. The right hemisphere thinks across categories, recognizes themes, and synthesizes the big picture. \u201cRight-brained\u201d or \u201clateral\u201d thinkers with more street smarts are often called \u201csmart.\u201d\n", "The diagram on the left summarizes the qualities of \u201cright-brained\u201d and \u201cleft-brained\u201d thinking types.\n", "Most people tend to get more of their instructions from one side than the other and they have trouble understanding people who get theirs from the opposite side. Our experience has been that left-brained folks tend to see right-brained folks as \u201cspacey\u201d or \u201cabstract,\u201d while right-brained thinkers tend to find left-brained thinkers \u201cliteral\u201d or \u201cnarrow.\u201d I have seen wonderful results occur when people know where their own and others\u2019 inclinations lie, realize that both ways of thinking are invaluable, and assign responsibilities accordingly.\n", "g. Understand how much the brain can and cannot change. This brings us to an important question: Can we change?31 We can all learn new facts and skills, but can we also learn to change how we are inclined to think? The answer is a qualified yes.\n", "Brain plasticity is what allows your brain to change its \u201csoftwiring.\u201d For a long time, scientists believed that after a certain critical period in childhood, most of our brain\u2019s neurological connections were fixed and highly unlikely to change. But recent research has suggested that a wide variety of practices\u2014from physical exercise to studying to meditation\u2014can lead to physical and physiological changes in our brains that affect our abilities to think and form memories. In a study of Buddhist monks who had practiced more than ten thousand hours of meditation, researchers at the University of Wisconsin measured significantly higher levels of gamma waves in their brains; these waves are associated with perception and problem solving.32\n", "That doesn\u2019t mean the brain is infinitely flexible. If you have a preference for a certain way of thinking, you might be able to train yourself to operate another way and find that easier to do over time, but you\u2019re very unlikely to change your underlying preference. Likewise, you may be able to train yourself to be more creative, but if you\u2019re not naturally creative, there\u2019s likely a limit to what you can do. That is simply reality, so we all might as well accept it and learn how to deal with it. There are coping techniques that we can use\u2014for example, the creative, disorganized person who is likely to lose track of time can develop the habit of using alarms; the person who isn\u2019t good at some type of thinking can train himself to rely on the thinking of others who are better at it. The best way to change is through doing mental exercises. As with physical exercise, this can be painful unless you enlist the habit loop discussed earlier to connect the rewards to the actions, \u201crewiring\u201d your brain to love learning and beneficial change.\n", "Remember that accepting your weaknesses is contrary to the instincts of those parts of your brain that want to hold on to the illusion that you are perfect. Doing the things that will reduce your instinctual defensiveness takes practice, and requires operating in an environment that reinforces open-mindedness.\n", "As you\u2019ll see when we get into Work Principles, I\u2019ve developed a number of tools and techniques that help overcome that resistance, individually and across organizations. Instead of expecting yourself or others to change, I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s often most effective to acknowledge one\u2019s weaknesses and create explicit guardrails against them. This is typically a faster and higher-probability path to success.\n"], "Find out what you and others are like.": ["Find out what you and others are like.\n", "Because of the biases with which we are wired, our self-assessments (and our assessments of others) tend to be highly inaccurate. Psychometric assessments are much more reliable. They are important in helping explore how people think during the hiring process and throughout employment. Though psychometric assessments cannot fully replace speaking with people and looking at their backgrounds and histories, they are far more powerful than traditional interviewing and screening methods. If I had to choose between just the assessments or just traditional job interviews to get at what people are like, I would choose the assessments. Fortunately, we don\u2019t have to make that choice.\n", "The four main assessments we use are the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Workplace Personality Inventory, the Team Dimensions Profile, and Stratified Systems Theory.33 But we are constantly experimenting (for example, with the Big Five) so our mix will certainly change. Whatever the mix, they all convey people\u2019s preferences for thinking and action. They also provide us with new attributes and terminologies that clarify and amplify those we had identified on our own. I will describe a few of them below. These descriptions are based on my own experiences and learnings, which are in many ways different from the official descriptions used by the assessment companies.34\n", "a. Introversion vs. extroversion. Introverts focus on the inner world and get their energy from ideas, memories, and experiences while extroverts are externally focused and get their energy from being with people. Introversion and extroversion are also linked to differences in communication styles. If you have a friend who loves to \u201ctalk out\u201d ideas (and even has trouble thinking through something if there isn\u2019t someone around to work it through with), he or she is likely an extrovert. Introverts will usually find such conversations painful, preferring to think privately and share only after they\u2019ve worked things out on their own. I\u2019ve found that it is important to help each communicate in the way that they feel most comfortable. For example, introverts often prefer communicating in writing (such as email) rather than speaking in group settings and tend to be less open with their critical thoughts.\n", "b. Intuiting vs. sensing. Some people see big pictures (forests) and others see details (trees). In the Myers-Briggs framework, these ways of seeing are best represented by the continuum from intuiting to sensing. You can get an idea of people\u2019s preferences by observing what they focus on. For example, when reading, a sensing person who focuses on details can be thrown off by typos such as \u201cthere\u201d instead of \u201ctheir,\u201d while intuitive thinkers won\u2019t even notice the mistake. That is because the intuitive thinker\u2019s attention is focused on the context first and the details second. Naturally, you\u2019d rather have a sensing person than an intuitor preparing your legal documents, where every \u201ci\u201d must be properly dotted and every \u201ct\u201d crossed just so.\n", "c. Thinking vs. feeling. Some people make decisions based on logical analysis of objective facts, considering all the known, provable factors important to a given situation and using logic to determine the best course of action. This approach is an indicator of a preference for thinking and is how you\u2019d hope your doctor thinks when he makes a diagnosis. Other people\u2014who prefer feeling\u2014focus on harmony between people. They are better suited to roles that require lots of empathy, interpersonal contact, and relationship building, for example HR and customer service. Before we had assessments to identify these differences, conversations between \u201cTs\u201d and \u201cFs\u201d were really frustrating. Now we laugh as we bump up against our differences, because we know what they are and can see them playing out in classic ways.\n", "d. Planning vs. perceiving. Some people like to live in a planned, orderly way and others prefer flexibility and spontaneity.35 Planners (or \u201cJudgers\u201d in Myers-Briggs terms) like to focus on a plan and stick with it, while perceivers are prone to focus on what\u2019s happening around them and adapt to it. Perceivers work from the outside in; they see things happening and work backward to understand the cause and how to respond; they also see many possibilities that they compare and choose from\u2014often so many that they are confused by them. In contrast, planners work from the inside out, first figuring out what they want to achieve and then how things should unfold. Planners and perceivers have trouble appreciating each other. Perceivers see new things and change direction often. This is discomforting to planners, who weigh precedent much more heavily in their decision making, and assume if it was done in a certain way before, it should be done in the same way again. Similarly, planners can discomfort perceivers by being seemingly rigid and slow to adapt.\n", "e. Creators vs. refiners vs. advancers vs. executors vs. flexors. By identifying talents and preferences that lead people to feel a particular way, you can place them in jobs at which they will likely excel. At Bridgewater, we use a test called the \u201cTeam Dimensions Profile\u201d (TDP) to connect people with their preferred role. The five types identified by the TDP are Creators, Refiners, Advancers, Executors, and Flexors.\n", "\u2022 Creators generate new ideas and original concepts. They prefer unstructured and abstract activities and thrive on innovation and unconventional practices.\n", "\u2022 Advancers communicate these new ideas and carry them forward. They relish feelings and relationships and manage the human factors. They are excellent at generating enthusiasm for work.\n", "\u2022 Refiners challenge ideas. They analyze projects for flaws, then refine them with a focus on objectivity and analysis. They love facts and theories and working with a systematic approach.\n", "\u2022 Executors can also be thought of as Implementers. They ensure that important activities are carried out and goals accomplished; they are focused on details and the bottom line.\n", "\u2022 Flexors are a combination of all four types. They can adapt their styles to fit certain needs and are able to look at a problem from a variety of perspectives.\n", "Triangulating what I learn from each test reinforces or raises questions about the pictures of people I\u2019m forming in my head. For example, when people\u2019s MBTI results suggest a preference for \u201cS\u201d (focus on details) and \u201cJ\u201d (planful), and they come out as executors on the Team Dimension assessment, there is a very good chance that they are more detail-focused than right-brained and imaginative, which means that they would likely fit better in jobs that have less ambiguity and more structure and clarity.\n", "f. Focusing on tasks vs. focusing on goals. Some people are focused on daily tasks while others are focused on their goals and how to achieve them. I\u2019ve found these differences to be quite similar to the differences between people who are intuitive vs. sensing. Those who tend to focus on goals and \u201cvisualize\u201d best can see the big pictures over time and are also more likely to make meaningful changes and anticipate future events. These goal-oriented people can step back from the day-to-day and reflect on what and how they\u2019re doing. They are the most suitable for creating new things (organizations, projects, etc.) and managing organizations that have lots of change. They typically make the most visionary leaders because of their ability to take a broad view and see the whole picture.\n", "In contrast, those who tend to focus on daily tasks are better at managing things that don\u2019t change much or that require processes to be completed reliably. Task-oriented people tend to make incremental changes that reference what already exists. They are slower to depart from the status quo and more likely to be blindsided by sudden events. On the other hand, they\u2019re typically more reliable. Although it may seem that their focus is narrower than higher-level thinkers, the roles they play are no less critical. I would never have gotten this book out or accomplished hardly anything else worthwhile if I didn\u2019t work with people who are wonderful at taking care of details.\n", "g. Workplace Personality Inventory. Another assessment we use is the Workplace Personality Inventory, a test based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor. It anticipates behavior and predicts job fit and satisfaction, singling out certain key characteristics/qualities, including persistence, independence, stress tolerance, and analytical thinking. This test helps us understand what people value and how they will make trade-offs between their values. For example, someone with low Achievement Orientation and high Concern for Others might be unwilling to step on others\u2019 toes in order to accomplish their goals. Likewise, someone who is bad at Rule Following may be more likely to think independently.\n", "We have found that something like twenty-five to fifty attributes can pretty well describe what a person is like. Each one comes in varying degrees of strength (like color tones). If you know what they are and put them together correctly, they will paint a pretty complete picture of a person. Our objective is to use test results and other information to try to do just that. We prefer to do it in partnership with the person being looked at, because it helps us be more accurate and at the same time it\u2019s very helpful to them to see themselves objectively.\n", "Certain attributes combine frequently to produce recognizable archetypes. If you think about it, you can probably come up with a handful of archetypal people you meet over and over again in life: the spacey, impractical Artist; the tidy Perfectionist; the Crusher who runs through brick walls to get things done; the Visionary who pulls amazing big ideas seemingly out of the air. Over time I came up with a list of others, including Shaper, Chirper, Tweaker, and Open-Minded Learner, as well as Advancer, Creator, Cat-Herder, Gossiper, Loyal Doer, Wise Judge, and others.\n", "To be clear, archetypes are less useful than the better fleshed-out pictures created through the assessments. They are not precise; they are more like simple caricatures, but they can be useful when it comes to assembling teams. Individual people will always be more complex than the archetypes that describe them, and they may well match up with more than one. For example, the Spacey Artist may or may not also be a Perfectionist or may be a Crusher too. While I won\u2019t go over all of them, I will describe Shapers\u2014the one that best represents me\u2014in some depth.\n", "h. Shapers are people who can go from visualization to actualization. I wrote a lot about the people I call \u201cshapers\u201d in the first part of this book. I use the word to mean someone who comes up with unique and valuable visions and builds them out beautifully, typically over the doubts of others. Shapers get both the big picture and the details right. To me, it seems that Shaper = Visionary + Practical Thinker + Determined.\n", "I\u2019ve found that shapers tend to share attributes such as intense curiosity and a compulsive need to make sense of things, independent thinking that verges on rebelliousness, a need to dream big and unconventionally, a practicality and determination to push through all obstacles to achieve their goals, and a knowledge of their own and others\u2019 weaknesses and strengths so they can orchestrate teams to achieve them. Perhaps even more importantly, they can hold conflicting thoughts simultaneously and look at them from different angles. They typically love to knock things around with other really smart people and can easily navigate back and forth between the big picture and the granular details, counting both as equally important.\n", "People wired with enough of these ways of thinking that they can operate in the world as shapers are very rare. But they could never succeed without working with others who are more naturally suited for other things and whose ways of thinking and acting are also essential.\n", "Knowing how one is wired is a necessary first step on any life journey. It doesn\u2019t matter what you do with your life, as long as you are doing what is consistent with your nature and your aspirations. Having spent time with some of the richest, most powerful, most admired people in the world, as well as some of the poorest, most disadvantaged people in the most obscure corners of the globe, I can assure you that, beyond a basic level, there is no correlation between happiness levels and conventional markers of success. A carpenter who derives his deepest satisfaction from working with wood can easily have a life as good or better than the president of the United States. If you\u2019ve learned anything from this book I hope it\u2019s that everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and everyone has an important role to play in life. Nature made everything and everyone for a purpose.

The best way to do that is to consciously develop habits that will make doing the things that are good for you habitual. In managing others, the analogy that comes to mind is a great orchestra. The person in charge is the shaper-conductor who doesn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d (e.g., doesn\u2019t play an instrument, though he or she knows a lot about instruments) as much as visualize the outcome and sees to it that each member of the orchestra helps achieve it. The conductor makes sure each member of the orchestra knows what he or she is good at and what they\u2019re not good at, and what their responsibilities are. Each must not only perform at their personal best but work together so the orchestra becomes more than the sum of its parts. One of the conductor\u2019s hardest and most thankless jobs is getting rid of people who consistently don\u2019t play well individually or with others. Most importantly, the conductor ensures that the score is executed exactly as he or she hears it in his or her head. \u201cThe music needs to sound this way,\u201d she says, and then she makes sure it does. \u201cBass players, bring out the structure.

For example, with the bond systemization project I mentioned earlier, having this new perspective allowed us to better see the gaps between what we had and what we needed. While Bob was a great intellectual partner to me in understanding the big-picture problem we wanted to solve, he was much weaker at visualizing the process required to get us from where we were to the solution. He also wasn\u2019t surrounding himself with the right people. He tended to want to work with people who were like him, so his main deputy on the project was a great sparring partner for mapping out big ideas on a whiteboard but a lousy one for fleshing out the who, what, and when needed to bring those ideas to life. This deputy tested as a \u201cFlexor,\u201d meaning that he was great at going in whatever direction Bob wanted to but lacked the clear, independent view needed to keep Bob on track.\n", "After a few rounds of not making progress, we used our new tools for understanding people and acted on them, pushing Bob to transition to a new deputy who was especially skilled at navigating the levels between the big-picture ideas and the discrete, smaller projects required to bring them about. Comparing the new deputy\u2019s Baseball Card to the original deputy\u2019s, she excelled in independent and systematic thinking, which were essential for having a clear picture of what to do with Bob\u2019s big ideas. This new deputy brought on other layers of support, including a project manager who was less engaged with the concepts and much more focused on the details of specific tasks and deadlines. When we looked at the new team members\u2019 Baseball Cards, we could quickly see them lighting up in some of the areas around being planful, concrete, and driving things to completion, which were areas of weakness for Bob.

For example, think about how you choose and maintain a safe distance behind the car in front of you when you are driving. Now describe the process in enough detail that someone who has never driven a car before can do it as well as you can, or so that it can be programmed into the computer that controls an autonomous car.

As explained in Chapter One, your brain stores different types of learning in your subconscious, your rote memory bank, and your habits. But no matter how you acquire your knowledge or where you store it, what\u2019s most important is that what you know paints a true and rich picture of the realities that will affect your decision. That\u2019s why it always pays to be radically open-minded and seek out believable others as you do your learning. Many people have emotional trouble doing this and block the learning that could help them make better decisions. Remind yourself that it\u2019s never harmful to at least hear an opposing point of view.\n", "Deciding is the process of choosing which knowledge should be drawn upon\u2014both the facts of this particular \u201cwhat is\u201d and your broader understanding of the cause-effect machinery that underlies it\u2014and then weighing them to determine a course of action, the \u201cwhat to do about it.\u201d This involves playing different scenarios through time to visualize how to get an outcome consistent with what you want. To do this well, you need to weigh first-order consequences against second- and third-order consequences, and base your decisions not just on near-term results but on results over time.\n", "Failing to consider second- and third-order consequences is the cause of a lot of painfully bad decisions, and it is especially deadly when the first inferior option confirms your own biases. Never seize on the first available option, no matter how good it seems, before you\u2019ve asked questions and explored. To prevent myself from falling into this trap, I used to literally ask myself questions: Am I learning? Have I learned enough yet that it\u2019s time for deciding?

(To make the example more concrete, imagine you\u2019re running an ice cream shop and the W\u2019s represent sales, the X\u2019s represent customer experience ratings, the Y\u2019s represent press and reviews, the Z\u2019s represent staff engagement, etc.) Keep in mind that our example is a relatively simple one: just eight occurrences over one day.\n", "From the chart on the right, you can see that it was a great day for sales (because the W\u2019s are at the top) and a bad day for customer experience (the X\u2019s).

You\u2019ll increase your chances of succeeding at it if you follow the next principle.\n", "a. Keep in mind both the rates of change and the levels of things, and the relationships between them. When determining an acceptable rate of improvement for something, it is its level in relation to the rate of change that matters. I often see people lose sight of this. They say \u201cit\u2019s getting better\u201d without noticing how far below the bar it is and whether the rate of change will get it above the bar in an acceptable amount of time. If someone who has been getting grades of 30s and 40s on their tests raised their scores to 50s over the course of a few months it would be accurate to say that they are getting better, but they would still be woefully inadequate. Everything important in your life needs to be on a trajectory to be above the bar and headed toward excellent at an appropriate pace. The lines in the chart on the next page show how the dots connect through time. A\u2019s trajectory gets you above the bar in an appropriate amount of time; B\u2019s does not. To make good decisions, you need to understand the reality of which of these two cases is happening.\n", "b. Be imprecise. Understand the concept of \u201cby-and-large\u201d and use approximations. Because our educational system is hung up on precision, the art of being good at approximations is insufficiently valued. This impedes conceptual thinking. For example, when asked to multiply 38 by 12, most people do it the slow and hard way rather than simply rounding 38 up to 40, rounding 12 down to 10, and quickly determining that the answer is about 400. Look at the ice cream shop example and imagine the value of quickly seeing the approximate relationships between the dots versus taking the time to see all the edges precisely. It would be silly to spend time doing that, yet that\u2019s exactly what most people do. \u201cBy-and-large\u201d is the level at which you need to understand most things in order to make effective decisions.

To help people at Bridgewater avoid this time waster, one of our just-out-of-college associates coined a saying I often repeat: \u201cWhen you ask someone whether something is true and they tell you that it\u2019s not totally true, it\u2019s probably by-and-large true.\u201d\n", "c. Remember the 80/20 Rule and know what the key 20 percent is. The 80/20 Rule states that you get 80 percent of the value out of something from 20 percent of the information or effort. (It\u2019s also true that you\u2019re likely to exert 80 percent of your effort getting the final 20 percent of value.) Understanding this rule saves you from getting bogged down in unnecessary detail once you\u2019ve gotten most of the learning you need to make a good decision.\n", "d. Be an imperfectionist. Perfectionists spend too much time on little differences at the margins at the expense of the important things.

An above-the-line conversation addresses the main points and a below-the-line conversation focuses on the sub-points. When a line of reasoning is jumbled and confusing, it\u2019s often because the speaker has gotten caught up in below-the-line details without connecting them back to the major points.

Remember that decisions need to be made at the appropriate level, but they should also be consistent across levels. For instance, if you want to have a healthy life, you shouldn\u2019t have twelve sausage links and a beer every day for breakfast.

While many of these tools are helpful, the fundamentals of effective decision making are relatively simple and timeless\u2014in fact they are genetically encoded in our brains to varying degrees. Watch animals in the wild and you\u2019ll see that they instinctively make expected value calculations to optimize the energy they expend to find food. Those that did this well prospered and passed on their genes through the process of natural selection; those that did it poorly perished.

If it\u2019s not, the process will inevitably be dominated by the most powerful rather than the most insightful participants, which is not only unfair but suboptimal. Successful organizations have cultures in which evidence-based decision making is the norm rather than the exception.\n"], "Make your decisions as expected value calculations.": ["Make your decisions as expected value calculations.\n", "Think of every decision as a bet with a probability and a reward for being right and a probability and a penalty for being wrong.

If you multiply the reward by the probability of being right you get $60 and if you multiply the penalty by the probability of being wrong (40 percent) you get $40. If you subtract the penalty from the reward, the difference is the expected value, which in this case is positive (+$20). Once you understand expected value, you also understand that it\u2019s not always best to bet on what\u2019s most probable. For example, suppose something that has only a one-in-five chance (20 percent) of succeeding will return ten times (e.g., $1,000) the amount that it will cost you if it fails ($100). Its expected value is positive ($120), so it\u2019s probably a smart decision, even though the odds are against you, as long as you can also cover the loss. Play these probabilities over and over again and they will surely give you winning results over time.\n", "Though we mostly don\u2019t carry out these calculations explicitly, we constantly make them intuitively. For example, when you decide to take an umbrella to the store even though there\u2019s just a 40 percent chance of rain, or you check your phone to confirm the directions somewhere, even though you\u2019re almost certain you know the way, you\u2019re making expected value calculations.\n", "Sometimes it\u2019s smart to take a chance even when the odds are overwhelmingly against you if the cost of being wrong is negligible relative to the reward that comes with the slim chance of being right.

To make matters worse, I was pretty sure I would be turned down for an adequate mortgage. But I figured that it wouldn\u2019t cost me anything to call the owner to see if we could work something out.

Raising the probability of being right is valuable no matter what your probability of being right already is. I often observe people making decisions if their odds of being right are greater than 50 percent. What they fail to see is how much better off they\u2019d be if they raised their chances even more (you can almost always improve your odds of being right by doing things that will give you more information). The expected value gain from raising the probability of being right from 51 percent to 85 percent (i.e., by 34 percentage points) is seventeen times more than raising the odds of being right from 49 percent (which is probably wrong) to 51 percent (which is only a little more likely to be right). Think of the probability as a measure of how often you\u2019re likely to be wrong. Raising the probability of being right by 34 percentage points means that a third of your bets will switch from losses to wins.

It typically leads me to make better decisions than I could have otherwise and it typically provides me with thrilling learning. I urge you to do it.\n", "To do it well, be sure to avoid the common perils of: 1) valuing your own believability more than is logical and 2) not distinguishing between who is more or less credible.\n", "In case of a disagreement with others, start by seeing if you can agree on the principles that should be used to make that decision. This discussion should include exploring the merits of the reasoning behind the different principles. If you agree on them, apply them to the case at hand and you\u2019ll arrive at a conclusion everyone agrees on. If you disagree on the principles, try to work through your disagreement based on your respective believabilities. I will explain how we do this in more detail in Work Principles.\n", "This sort of principled and believability-weighted decision making is fascinating and leads to much different and much better decision making than is typical. For example, imagine if we used this approach to choose the president. It would be fascinating to see which principles we would come up with both for determining what makes a good president as well as for deciding who is most believable in making such determinations. Would we wind up with something like one person one vote, or something different? And if different, in what ways? It certainly would lead to very different outcomes. During the next election, let\u2019s do this in parallel with our ordinary electoral process so we can see the difference.\n", "While believability-weighted decision making can sound complicated, chances are you do it all the time\u2014pretty much whenever you ask yourself, \u201cWho should I listen to?\u201d But it\u2019s almost certainly true that you\u2019d do it a lot better if you gave more thought to it.\n"], "Convert your principles into algorithms and have the computer make decisions alongside you.": ["Convert your principles into algorithms and have the computer make decisions alongside you.\n", "If you can do that, you will take the power of your decision making to a whole other level. In many cases, you will be able to test how that principle would have worked in the past or in various situations that will help you refine it, and in all cases, it will allow you to compound your understanding to a degree that would otherwise be impossible. It will also take emotion out of the equation. Algorithms work just like words in describing what you would like to have done, but they are written in a language that the computer can understand. If you don\u2019t know how to speak this language, you should either learn it or have someone close to you who can translate for you. Your children and their peers must learn to speak this language because it will soon be as important or more important than any other language.\n", "By developing a partnership with your computer alter ego in which you teach each other and each do what you do best, you will be much more powerful than if you went about your decision making alone. The computer will also be your link to great collective decision making, which is far more powerful than individual decision making, and will almost certainly advance the evolution of our species.\n", "SYSTEMIZED AND COMPUTERIZED DECISION MAKING\n", "In the future, artificial intelligence will have a profound impact on how we make decisions in every aspect of our lives\u2014especially when combined with the new era of radical transparency about people that\u2019s already upon us. Right now, whether you like it or not, it is easy for anyone to access your digital data to learn a tremendous amount about what you\u2019re like, and this data can be fed into computers that do everything from predict what you\u2019re likely to buy to what you value in life. While this sounds scary to many people, at Bridgewater we have been combining radical transparency with algorithmic decision making for more than thirty years and have found that it produces remarkable results. In fact, I believe that it won\u2019t be long before this kind of computerized decision making guides us nearly as much as our brains do now.\n", "The concept of artificial intelligence is not new. Even back in the 1970s, when I first started experimenting with computerized decision making, it had already been around for nearly twenty years (the term \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d was first introduced in 1956 at a conference at Dartmouth College). While a lot has changed since then, the basic concepts remain the same.\n", "To give you just one ultrasimple example of how computerized decision making works, let\u2019s say you have two principles for heating your home: You want to turn the heat on when the temperature falls below 68 and you want to turn the heat off between midnight and 5:00 a.m. You can express the relationship between these criteria in a simple decision-making formula: If the temperature is less than 68 degrees and the time is not between 5:00 a.m. and midnight, then turn on the heat. By gathering many such formulas, it\u2019s possible to create a decision-making system that takes in data, applies and weighs the relevant criteria, and recommends a decision.\n", "THINKING\n", "PRINCIPLES\n", "ALGORITHMS\n", "Specifying our investment decision-making criteria in algorithms and running historical data through them, or specifying our work principles in algorithms and using them to aid in management decision making, are just bigger and more complicated versions of that smart thermostat. They allow us to make more informed and less emotional decisions much faster than we could on our own.\n", "I believe that people will increasingly do this and that computer coding will become as essential as writing. In time, we will use machine assistants as much for decision making as we do for information gathering today. As these machines help us, they will learn about what we are like\u2014what we value, what our strengths and weaknesses are\u2014and they will be able to tailor the advice they give us by automatically seeking out the help of others who are strong where we are weak. It won\u2019t be long before our machine assistants are speaking to others\u2019 machine assistants and collaborating in this way. In fact, that\u2019s beginning to happen already.\n", "Imagine a world in which you can use technology to connect to a system in which you can input the issue you\u2019re dealing with and have exchanges about what you should do and why with the highest-rated thinkers in the world. We\u2019ll soon be able to do this. Before too long, you will be able to tap the highest-quality thinking on nearly every issue you face and get the guidance of a computerized system that weighs different points of view. For example, you will be able to ask what lifestyle or career you should choose given what you\u2019re like, or how to best interact with specific people based on what they\u2019re like. These innovations will help people get out of their own heads and unlock an incredibly powerful form of collective thinking. We are doing this now and have found it way better than traditional thinking.\n", "While this kind of view often leads to talk of artificial intelligence competing with human intelligence, in my opinion human and artificial intelligence are far more likely to work together because that will produce the best results. It\u2019ll be decades\u2014and maybe never\u2014before the computer can replicate many of the things that the brain can do in terms of imagination, synthesis, and creativity. That\u2019s because the brain comes genetically programmed with millions of years of abilities honed through evolution. The \u201cscience\u201d of decision making that underlies many computer systems remains much less valuable than the \u201cart.\u201d People still make the most important decisions better than computers do. To see this, you need look no further than at the kinds of people who are uniquely successful. Software developers, mathematicians, and game-theory modelers aren\u2019t running away with all the rewards; it is the people who have the most common sense, imagination, and determination.\n", "Only human intelligence can apply the interpretations that are required to provide computer models with appropriate input. For example, a computer can\u2019t tell you how to weigh the value of the time you spend with your loved ones against the time you spend at work or the optimal mix of hours that will provide you with the best marginal utilities for each activity. Only you know what you value most, who you want to share your life with, what kind of environment you want to be in, and ultimately how to make the best choices to bring those things about. What\u2019s more, so much of our thinking comes from the subconscious in ways we don\u2019t understand, that thinking we can model it fully is as unlikely as an animal that has never experienced abstract thinking attempting to define and replicate it.\n", "Yet at the same time, the brain cannot compete with the computer in many ways. Computers have much greater \u201cdetermination\u201d than any person, as they will work 24/7 for you. They can process vastly more information, and they can do it much faster, more reliably, and more objectively than you could ever hope to. They can bring millions of possibilities that you never thought of to your attention. Perhaps most important of all, they are immune to the biases and consensus-driven thinking of crowds; they don\u2019t care if what they see is unpopular, and they never panic. During those terrible days after 9/11, when the whole country was being whipsawed by emotion, or the weeks between September 19 and October 10, 2008, when the Dow fell 3,600 points, there were times I felt like hugging our computers. They kept their cool no matter what.\n", "This combination of man and machine is wonderful. The process of man\u2019s mind working with technology is what elevates us\u2014it\u2019s what has taken us from an economy where most people dig in the dirt to today\u2019s Information Age. It\u2019s for that reason that people who have common sense, imagination, and determination, who know what they value and what they want, and who also use computers, math, and game theory, are the best decision makers there are.

I categorize what is going on in the world of computer-aided decision making under three broad types: expert systems, mimicking, and data mining (these categories are mine and not the ones in common use in the technology world).\n", "Expert systems are what we use at Bridgewater, where designers specify criteria based on their logical understandings of a set of cause-effect relationships, and then see how different scenarios would emerge under different circumstances.\n", "But computers can also observe patterns and apply them in their decision making without having any understanding of the logic behind them. I call such an approach \u201cmimicking.\u201d This can be effective when the same things happen reliably over and over again and are not subject to change, such as in a game bounded by hard-and-fast rules. But in the real world things do change, so a system can easily fall out of sync with reality.\n", "The main thrust of machine learning in recent years has gone in the direction of data mining, in which powerful computers ingest massive amounts of data and look for patterns. While this approach is popular, it\u2019s risky in cases when the future might be different from the past. Investment systems built on machine learning that is not accompanied by deep understanding are dangerous because when some decision rule is widely believed, it becomes widely used, which affects the price. In other words, the value of a widely known insight disappears over time. Without deep understanding, you won\u2019t know if what happened in the past is genuinely of value and, even if it was, you will not be able to know whether or not its value has disappeared\u2014or worse. It\u2019s common for some decision rules to become so popular that they push the price far enough that it becomes smarter to do the opposite.\n", "Remember that computers have no common sense. For example, a computer could easily misconstrue the fact that people wake up in the morning and then eat breakfast to indicate that waking up makes people hungry. I\u2019d rather have fewer bets (ideally uncorrelated ones) in which I am highly confident than more bets I\u2019m less confident in, and would consider it intolerable if I couldn\u2019t argue the logic behind any of my decisions. A lot of people vest their blind faith in machine learning because they find it much easier than developing deep understanding. For me, that deep understanding is essential, especially for what I do.\n", "I don\u2019t mean to imply that these mimicking or data-mining systems, as I call them, are useless. In fact, I believe that they can be extremely useful in making decisions in which the future range and configuration of events are the same as they\u2019ve been in the past. Given enough computing power, all possible variables can be taken into consideration. For example, by analyzing data about the moves that great chess players have made under certain circumstances, or the procedures great surgeons have used during certain types of operations, valuable programs can be created for chess playing or surgery. Back in 1997, the computer program Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov, the world\u2019s highest-ranked chess player, using just this approach. But this approach fails in cases where the future is different from the past and you don\u2019t know the cause-effect relationships well enough to recognize them all. Understanding these relationships as I do has saved me from making mistakes when others did, most obviously in the 2008 financial crisis. Nearly everyone else assumed that the future would be similar to the past. Focusing strictly on the logical cause-effect relationships was what allowed us to see what was really going on.\n", "When you get down to it, our brains are essentially computers that are programmed in certain ways, take in data, and spit out instructions. We can program the logic in both the computer that is our mind and the computer that is our tool so that they can work together and even double-check each other. Doing that is fabulous.\n", "For example, suppose we were trying to derive the universal laws that explain species change over time. Theoretically, with enough processing power and time, this should be possible. We would need to make sense of the formulas the computer produces, of course, to make sure that they are not data-mined gibberish, by which I mean based on correlations that are not causal in any way. We would do this by constantly simplifying these rules until their elegance is unmistakable.\n", "Of course, given our brain\u2019s limited capacity and processing speed, it could take us forever to achieve a rich understanding of all the variables that go into evolution. Is all the simplifying and understanding that we employ in our expert systems truly required? Maybe not. There is certainly a risk that changes not in the tested data might still occur. But one might argue that if our data-mining-based formulas seem able to account for the evolution of all species through all time, then the risks of relying on them for just the next ten, twenty, or fifty years is relatively low compared to the benefits of having a formula that appears to work but is not fully understandable (and that, at the very least, might prove useful in helping scientists cure genetic diseases).\n", "In fact, we may be too hung up on understanding; conscious thinking is only one part of understanding. Maybe it\u2019s enough that we derive a formula for change and use it to anticipate what is yet to come. I myself find the excitement, lower risk, and educational value of achieving a deep understanding of cause-effect relationships much more appealing than a reliance on algorithms I don\u2019t understand, so I am drawn to that path. But is it my lower-level preferences and habits that are pulling me in this direction or is it my logic and reason? I\u2019m not sure. I look forward to probing the best minds in artificial intelligence on this (and having them probe me).\n", "Most likely, our competitive natures will compel us to place bigger and bigger bets on relationships computers find that are beyond our understanding. Some of those bets will pay off, while others will backfire. I suspect that AI will lead to incredibly fast and remarkable advances, but I also fear that it could lead to our demise.\n", "We are headed for an exciting and perilous new world.

I believe that because the same kinds of things happen over and over again, a relatively few well-thought-out principles will allow you to deal with just about anything that reality throws at you. Where you get these principles from doesn\u2019t matter as much as having them and using them consistently\u2014and that you never stop refining and improving them.\n", "To acquire principles that work, it\u2019s essential that you embrace reality and deal with it well. Don\u2019t fall into the common trap of wishing that reality worked differently than it does or that your own realities were different. Instead, embrace your realities and deal with them effectively. After all, making the most of your circumstances is what life is all about. This includes being transparent with your thoughts and open-mindedly accepting the feedback of others. Doing so will dramatically increase your learning.\n", "Along your journey you will inevitably experience painful failures. It is important to realize that they can either be the impetus that fuels your personal evolution or they can ruin you, depending on how you react to them. I believe that evolution is the greatest force in the universe and that we all evolve in basically the same way. Conceptually, it looks like a series of loops that either lead upward toward constant improvement or remain flat or even trend downward toward ruin. You will determine what your own loops look like.\n", "Your evolutionary process can be described as a 5-Step Process for getting what you want. It consists of setting goals, identifying and not tolerating problems, diagnosing problems, coming up with designs to get around them, and then doing the tasks required. The important thing to remember is that no one can do all the steps well, but that it\u2019s possible to rely on others to help. Different people with different abilities working well together create the most powerful machines to produce achievements.\n", "If you\u2019re willing to confront reality, accept the pain that comes with doing so, and follow the 5-Step Process to drive yourself toward your goals, you\u2019re on the path to success. Yet most people fail to do this because they hold on to bad opinions that could easily be rectified by going above themselves to objectively look down at their situation and weigh what they and others think about it. It\u2019s for that reason I believe you must be radically open-minded.\n", "Our biggest barriers for doing this well are our ego barrier and our blind spot barrier. The ego barrier is our innate desire to be capable and have others recognize us as such. The blind spot barrier is the result of our seeing things through our own subjective lenses; both barriers can prevent us from seeing how things really are. The most important antidote for them is radical open-mindedness, which is motivated by the genuine worry that one might not be seeing one\u2019s choices optimally. It is the ability to effectively explore different points of view and different possibilities without letting your ego or your blind spots get in your way.\n", "Doing this well requires practicing thoughtful disagreement, which is the process of seeking out brilliant people who disagree with you in order to see things through their eyes and gain a deeper understanding. Doing this will raise your probability of making good decisions and will also give you a fabulous education. If you can learn radical open-mindedness and practice thoughtful disagreement, you\u2019ll radically increase your learning.\n", "Finally, being radically open-minded requires you to have an accurate self-assessment of your own and others\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. This is where understanding something about how the brain works and the different psychometric assessments that can help you discover what your own brain is like comes in. To get the best results out of yourself and others, you must understand that people are wired very differently.\n", "In a nutshell, learning how to make decisions in the best possible way and learning to have the courage to make them comes from a) going after what you want, b) failing and reflecting well through radical open-mindedness, and c) changing/evolving to become ever more capable and less fearful. In the final chapter of this section, Learn How to Make Decisions Effectively, I shared some more granular principles for how to do all of the above and weigh your options in specific situations to determine the right path to follow.\n", "You can of course do all of these things alone, but if you\u2019ve understood anything about the concept of radical open-mindedness, it should be obvious that going it alone will only take you so far. We all need others to help us triangulate and get to the best possible decisions\u2014and to help us see our weaknesses objectively and compensate for them. More than anything else, your life is affected by the people around you and how you interact with each other.\n", "Your ability to get what you want when working with others who want the same things is much greater than your ability to get these things by yourself. Yet we haven\u2019t talked about how groups should operate to be most effective. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do in Work Principles.\n", "Work Principles is about people working together. Because the power of a group is so much greater than the power of an individual, the principles that follow are likely even more important than those we covered up to this point. In fact, I wrote them first and then wrote Life Principles in order to help others make sense of the approach I was implicitly applying in running Bridgewater. My Work Principles are basically the Life Principles you just read, applied to groups. I will show you, principle by principle, how an actual, practical, believability-weighted decision-making system converts independent thinking into effective group decision making. I believe that such a system can work to make any kind of organization\u2014business, government, philanthropic\u2014both more effective and more satisfying to belong to.\n", "I hope these principles will help you struggle well and get all the joy you can out of life.\n", "I don\u2019t mean that they must be aligned on everything, but I do mean that they have to be aligned on the most important things, like the mission they\u2019re on and how they will be with each other.\n", "If people in an organization feel that alignment, they will treasure their relationships and work together harmoniously; its culture will permeate everything they do. If they don\u2019t, they will work for different, often conflicting, goals and will be confused about how they should be with each other. For that reason, it pays for all organizations\u2014companies, governments, foundations, schools, hospitals, and so on\u2014to spell out their principles and values clearly and explicitly and to operate by them consistently.\n", "Those principles and values aren\u2019t vague slogans, like \u201cthe customer always comes first\u201d or \u201cwe should strive to be the best in our industry,\u201d but a set of concrete directives anyone can understand, get aligned on, and carry out. As we shift our attention from Life Principles to Work Principles, I will explain how we went about achieving these alignments at Bridgewater and how that affected our results. But first, I want to explain how I think about organizations.\n", "\u2022 An organization is a machine consisting of two major parts: culture and people.\n", "Each influences the other, because the people who make up an organization determine the kind of culture it has, and the culture of the organization determines the kinds of people who fit in.\n", "a. A great organization has both great people and a great culture. Companies that get progressively better over time have both. Nothing is more important or more difficult than to get the culture and people right.\n", "b. Great people have both great character and great capabilities. By great character, I mean they are radically truthful, radically transparent, and deeply committed to the mission of the organization. By great capabilities, I mean they have the abilities and skills to do their jobs excellently. People who have one without the other are dangerous and should be removed from the organization. People who have both are rare and should be treasured.\n", "c. Great cultures bring problems and disagreements to the surface and solve them well, and they love imagining and building great things that haven\u2019t been built before. Doing that sustains their evolution. In our case, we do that by having an idea meritocracy that strives for meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical truth and radical transparency. By meaningful work, I mean work that people are excited to get their heads into, and by meaningful relationships I mean those in which there is genuine caring for each other (like an extended family). I find that these reinforce each other and that being radically truthful and radically transparent with each other makes both the work and the relationships go better.\n", "By constantly looking down on the machine, its managers can objectively compare the outcomes it produces with their goals. If those outcomes are consistent with those goals, then the machine is working effectively; if the outcomes are inconsistent with the goals, then something is wrong with either the design of the machine or the people who are a part of it and the problem needs to be diagnosed so the machine can be modified. As laid out in Chapter Two of Life Principles, this ideally happens in a 5-Step Process: 1) having clear goals, 2) identifying the problems preventing the goals from being achieved, 3) diagnosing what parts of the machine (i.e., which people or which designs) are not working well, 4) designing changes, and 5) doing what is needed. This is the fastest and most efficient way that an organization improves.\n", "I call this process of converting problems into progress \u201clooping,\u201d and how it happens through time is visualized in the diagrams to the right. In the first, a problem occurs that takes you off track from your goals and makes things worse than you planned.\n", "If you identify the decline, diagnose the problems that caused it so as to get at their root causes, come up with new designs, and then push them through, the trajectory will loop back on itself and continue its upward ascent, like in the second diagram.\n", "If you don\u2019t identify the problem, design a suboptimal solution, or fail to push it through effectively, the decline will continue as shown in the diagram at the bottom.\n", "A manager\u2019s ability to recognize when outcomes are inconsistent with goals and then modify designs and assemble people to rectify them makes all the difference in the world. The more often and more effectively a manager does this, the steeper the upward trajectory.\n", "As I explained in Life Principles, this is what I believe evolution looks like for all organisms and organizations. Having a culture and people that will evolve in this way is critical because the world changes quickly and in ways that can\u2019t possibly be anticipated. I\u2019m sure you can think of a number of companies that failed to identify and address their problems on time and ended up in a terminal decline (see: BlackBerry and Palm) and a rare few that have consistently looped well. Most don\u2019t. For example, only six of the companies that forty years ago made up the Dow Jones 30, which is about when Bridgewater got started, are still in the Dow 30 today. Many of them\u2014American Can, American Tobacco, Bethlehem Steel, General Foods, Inco, F. W. Woolworth\u2014don\u2019t even exist; some (Sears Roebuck, Johns-Manville, Eastman Kodak) are so different as to be almost unrecognizable. And many of the standouts on the list today\u2014Apple, Cisco\u2014were yet to be founded.\n", "The rare few that have been able to evolve well over the decades have been successful at that evolutionary/looping process, which also is the process that has made Bridgewater progressively more successful for forty years. That is the process I want to pass along to you.\n", "As I mentioned earlier, nothing is more important or more difficult than to get the culture and the people right. Whatever successes we\u2019ve had at Bridgewater were the result of doing that well\u2014and whatever failures were due to our not doing it adequately. That might seem odd because, as a global macroeconomic investor, one might think that, above all else, I had to get the economics and investments right, which is true. But to do that, I needed to get the people and culture right first. And, to inspire me to do what I did, I needed to have meaningful work and meaningful relationships.\n", "As the entrepreneur/builder of Bridgewater, I naturally shaped the organization to be consistent with my values and principles. I went after what I wanted most, in the way that seemed most natural to me with the people I chose to be with, and we and Bridgewater evolved together.\n", "If you had asked me what my objective was when I started out, I would\u2019ve said it was to have fun working with people I like. Work was a game I played with passion and I wanted to have a blast playing it with people I enjoyed and respected. I started Bridgewater out of my apartment with a pal I played rugby with who had no experience in the markets and a friend we hired as our assistant. I certainly wasn\u2019t thinking about management at the time. Management seemed to me like something people in gray suits with slide presentations did. I never set out to manage, let alone to have principles about work and management.\n", "From reading Life Principles, you know that I liked to imagine and build out new, practical concepts that never existed before. I especially loved doing these things with people who were on the same mission with me. I treasured thoughtful disagreement with them as a way of learning and raising our odds of making good decisions, and I wanted all the people I worked with to be my \u201cpartners\u201d rather than my \u201cemployees.\u201d In a nutshell, I was looking for meaningful work and meaningful relationships. I quickly learned that the best way to do that was to have great partnerships with great people.\n", "To me, great partnerships come from sharing common values and interests, having similar approaches to pursuing them, and being reasonable with, and having consideration for, each other. At the same time, partners must be willing to hold each other to high standards and work through their disagreements. The main test of a great partnership is not whether the partners ever disagree\u2014people in all healthy relationships disagree\u2014but whether they can bring their disagreements to the surface and get through them well. Having clear processes for resolving disagreements efficiently and clearly is essential for business partnerships, marriages, and all other forms of partnership.\n", "My wanting these things attracted others who wanted the same things, which drove how we shaped Bridgewater together.36 When there were five of us it was totally different than when there were fifty of us, which was totally different than it was when we were five hundred, a thousand, and so on. As we grew, most everything changed beyond recognition, except for our core values and principles.\n", "When Bridgewater was still a small company, the principles by which we operated were more implicit than explicit. But as more and more new people came in, I couldn\u2019t take for granted that they would understand and preserve them. I realized that I needed to write our principles out explicitly and explain the logic behind them. I remember the precise moment when this shift occurred\u2014it was when the number of people at Bridgewater passed sixty-seven. Up until then, I had personally chosen each employee\u2019s holiday gift and written them a lengthy personalized card, but trying to do it that year broke my back. From that point on, an increasing number of people came in who didn\u2019t work closely with me, so I couldn\u2019t assume they would understand where I was coming from or what I was striving to create, which was an idea meritocracy built on tough love.\n", "\u2022 Tough love is effective for achieving both great work and great relationships.\n", "To give you an idea of what I mean by tough love, think of Vince Lombardi, who for me personified it. From when I was ten years old until I was eighteen, Lombardi was head coach of the Green Bay Packers. With limited resources, he led his team to five NFL championships. He won two NFL Coach of the Year awards and many still call him the best coach of all time. Lombardi loved his players and he pushed them to be great. I admired, and still admire, how uncompromising his standards were. His players, their fans, and he himself all benefited from his approach. I wish Lombardi had written out his principles for me to read.\n", "a. In order to be great, one can\u2019t compromise the uncompromisable. Yet I see people doing it all the time, usually to avoid making others or themselves feel uncomfortable, which is not just backward but counterproductive. Putting comfort ahead of success produces worse results for everyone. I both loved the people I worked with and pushed them to be great, and I expected them to do the same with me.\n", "From the very beginning, I felt that the people I worked with at Bridgewater were a part of my extended family. When they or members of their families got sick, I put them in touch with my personal doctor to make sure that they were well taken care of. I invited all of them to stay at my house in Vermont on weekends and loved it when they took me up on it. I celebrated their marriages and the births of their children with them and mourned the losses of their loved ones. But to be clear, this was no lovefest. We were tough on each other too, so we could all be as great as we could be. I learned that the more caring we gave each other, the tougher we could be on each other, and the tougher we were on each other, the better we performed and the more rewards there were for us to share. This cycle was self-reinforcing. I found that operating this way made the lows less low and the highs higher. It even made the bad times better than the good ones in some important ways.\n", "Think about some of your toughest experiences in life. I bet it is as true for you as it has been for me that going through them with people you cared about, who cared about you, and who were working as hard as you were for the same mission, was incredibly rewarding. As hard as they were, we look back on some of these challenging times as our finest moments. For most people, being part of a great community on a shared mission is even more rewarding than money. Numerous studies have shown there is little to no correlation between one\u2019s happiness and the amount of money one accumulates, yet there is a strong correlation between one\u2019s happiness and the quality of one\u2019s relationships.\n", "I laid this out in a memo to Bridgewater in 1996:\n", "Bridgewater is not about plodding along at some kind of moderate standard, it is about working like hell to achieve a standard that is extraordinarily high, and then getting the satisfaction that comes along with that sort of super-achievement.\n", "Our overriding objective is excellence, or more precisely, constant improvement, a superb and constantly improving company in all respects.\n", "Conflict in the pursuit of excellence is a terrific thing. There should be no hierarchy based on age or seniority. Power should lie in the reasoning, not the position, of the individual. The best ideas win no matter who they come from.\n", "Criticism (by oneself and by others) is an essential ingredient in the improvement process, yet, if handled incorrectly, can be destructive. It should be handled objectively. There should be no hierarchy in the giving or receiving of criticism.\n", "Teamwork and team spirit are essential, including intolerance of substandard performance. This is referring to 1) one\u2019s recognition of the responsibilities one has to help the team achieve its common goals and 2) the willingness to help others (work within a group) toward these common goals. Our fates are intertwined. One should know that others can be relied upon to help. As a corollary, substandard performance cannot be tolerated anywhere because it would hurt everyone.\n", "Long-term relationships are both a) intrinsically gratifying and b)efficient, and should be intentionally built. Turnover requires re-training and therefore creates setbacks.\n", "Money is a byproduct of excellence, not a goal. Our overriding objective is excellence and constant improvement at Bridgewater. To be clear, it is not to make lots of money. The natural extension of this is not that you should be happy with little money. On the contrary\u2014you should expect to make a lot. If we operate consistently with this philosophy we should be productive and the company should do well financially. There is comparatively little age- and seniority-based hierarchy.\n", "Each person at Bridgewater should act like an owner, responsible for operating in this way and for holding others accountable to operate in this way.\n", "\u2022 A believability-weighted idea meritocracy is the best system for making effective decisions.\n", "Unlike Lombardi, whose success depended on having his players follow his instructions, I needed my players to be independent thinkers who could bang around their different points of view and reach better conclusions than any one of us could come up with on our own. I needed to create an environment in which everyone had the right and the responsibility to make sense of things for themselves and to fight openly for what they think is best\u2014and where the best thinking won out. I needed a real idea meritocracy, not some theoretical version of one. That\u2019s because an idea meritocracy\u2014i.e., a system that brings together smart, independent thinkers and has them productively disagree to come up with the best possible collective thinking and resolve their disagreements in a believability-weighted way\u2014will outperform any other decision-making system.\n", "Our idea-meritocratic system evolved over the decades. At first, we just argued like hell with each other about what was best and by thrashing through our disagreements came up with better paths than if we had made our decisions individually. But as Bridgewater grew and our range of disagreements and needs to resolve them changed, we became more explicit in how this idea meritocracy would work. We needed a system that could both effectively weigh the believability of different people to come to the best decisions and do that in a way that was so obviously fair everyone would recognize it as such. I knew that without such a system, we would lose both the best thinking and the best thinkers, and I\u2019d be stuck with either kiss-asses or subversives who kept their disagreements and hidden resentments to themselves.\n", "For this all to work, I believed and still believe that we need to be radically truthful and radically transparent with each other.\n", "RADICAL TRUTH AND RADICAL TRANSPARENCY\n", "By radical truth, I mean not filtering one\u2019s thoughts and one\u2019s questions, especially the critical ones. If we don\u2019t talk openly about our issues and have paths for working through them, we won\u2019t have partners who collectively own our outcomes.\n", "By radical transparency, I mean giving most everyone the ability to see most everything. To give people anything less than total transparency would make them vulnerable to others\u2019 spin and deny them the ability to figure things out for themselves. Radical transparency reduces harmful office politics and the risks of bad behavior because bad behavior is more likely to take place behind closed doors than out in the open.\n", "Some people have called this way of operating radical straightforwardness.\n", "I knew that if radical truth and radical transparency didn\u2019t apply across the board, we would develop two classes of people at the company\u2014those with power who are in the know, and those who aren\u2019t\u2014so I pushed them both to their limits. To me, a pervasive Idea Meritocracy = Radical Truth + Radical Transparency + Believability-Weighted Decision Making.\n", "From a small group of people arguing informally about what\u2019s true and what to do about it, we developed approaches, technologies, and tools over the last forty years that have taken us to a whole other level, which has been eye-opening and invaluable in ways that you can read about in the tools chapter at the end of this book. We have always been unwavering in providing this environment, and we let the people who didn\u2019t like it self-select themselves out of the company.\n", "By being radically truthful and radically transparent, we could see that we all have terribly incomplete and/or distorted perspectives. This isn\u2019t unique to Bridgewater\u2014you would recognize the same thing if you could see into the heads of the people around you. As explained in Understand That People Are Wired Very Differently, people tend to see the same situations in dramatically different ways, depending on how their brains are wired.\n", "Seeing this will help you evolve. At first most people remain stuck in their own heads, stubbornly clinging to the idea that their views are best and that something is wrong with other people who don\u2019t see things their way. But when they repeatedly face the questions \u201cHow do you know that you\u2019re not the wrong one?\u201d and \u201cWhat process would you use to draw upon these different perspectives to make the best decisions?\u201d they are forced to confront their own believability and see things through others\u2019 eyes as well as their own. This shift in perspective is what produces great collective decision making. Ideally, this takes place in an \u201copen-source\u201d way, with the best ideas flowing freely, living, dying, and producing rapid evolution based on their merits.\n", "Most people initially find this process very uncomfortable. While most appreciate it intellectually, they typically are challenged by it emotionally because it requires them to separate themselves from their ego\u2019s attachment to being right and try to see what they have a hard time seeing. A small minority get it and love it from the start, a slightly larger minority can\u2019t stand it and leave the company, and the majority stick with it, get better at it with time, and eventually wouldn\u2019t want to operate any other way.\n", "IDEA MERITOCRACY\n", "=\n", "RADICAL TRUTH\n", "+\n", "RADICAL TRANSPARENCY\n", "+\n", "BELIEVABILITY-WEIGHTED DECISION MAKING\n", "While operating this way might sound difficult and inefficient, it is actually extremely efficient. In fact, it is much harder and much less efficient to work in an organization in which most people don\u2019t know what their colleagues are really thinking. Also, when people can\u2019t be totally open, they can\u2019t be themselves. As Harvard developmental psychologist Bob Kegan, who has studied Bridgewater, likes to say, in most companies people are doing two jobs: their actual job and the job of managing others\u2019 impressions of how they\u2019re doing their job. For us, that\u2019s terrible. We\u2019ve found that bringing everything to the surface 1) removes the need to try to look good and 2) eliminates time required to guess what people are thinking. In doing so, it creates more meaningful work and more meaningful relationships.\n", "Here are the forces behind Bridgewater\u2019s self-reinforcing evolutionary spiral:\n", "1. We went from one independent thinker who wanted to achieve audacious goals to a group of independent thinkers who wanted to achieve audacious goals.\n", "2. To enable these independent thinkers to have effective collective decision making, we created an idea meritocracy based on principles that ensured we would be radically honest and transparent with each other, have thoughtful disagreements, and have idea-meritocratic ways of getting past our disagreements to make decisions.\n", "3. We recorded these decision-making principles on paper and later encoded them into computers and made our decisions based on them.\n", "4. This produced our successes and failures, which produced more learnings, which were written into more principles that were systemized and acted upon.\n", "5. This process resulted in excellent work and excellent relationships that led us to having well-rewarded and happy employees and clients.\n", "6. That led us to be able to bring in more audacious independent thinkers with more audacious goals to strengthen this self-reinforcing upward spiral.\n", "We did that over and over again, which produced the evolutionary looping behind Bridgewater\u2019s forty-plus years of success. It\u2019s shown in the diagram on the facing page.\n", "This really works! You don\u2019t have to take my word for it. There are two ways you can evaluate the likelihood that this approach and the principles that follow from it are as powerful as I believe they are. You can 1) look at the results they produced and 2) look at the logic behind them.\n", "As for the results, like Lombardi\u2019s and the Packers\u2019, our track record speaks for itself. We consistently got better over forty years, going from my two-bedroom apartment to become the fifth most impor-tant private company in the U.S., according to Fortune, and the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, making more total money for our clients than any other hedge fund in history. We have received over one hundred industry awards and I\u2019ve earned three lifetime achievement awards\u2014not to mention remarkable financial and psychological rewards, and most importantly, amazing relationships.\n", "But even more important than these results is the underlying cause-effect logic behind these principles, which came before the results. Over forty years ago, this way of being was a controversial, untested theory that nevertheless seemed logical to me. I will explain this logic to you in the pages that follow. That way, you can assess it for yourself.\n", "There\u2019s no doubt that our approach is very different. Some people have even described Bridgewater as a cult. The truth is that Bridgewater succeeds because it is the opposite of a cult. The essential difference between a culture of people with shared values (which is a great thing) and a cult (which is a terrible thing) is the extent to which there is independent thinking. Cults demand unquestioning obedience. Thinking for yourself and challenging each other\u2019s ideas is anti-cult behavior, and that is the essence of what we do at Bridgewater.\n", "WHO\u2019S CRAZY?\n", "Some people say that our approach is crazy, but think about it: Which approach do you think is crazy and which one is sensible?\n", "\u2022 One where people are truthful and transparent, or one in which most people keep their real thoughts hidden?\n", "\u2022 One where problems, mistakes, weaknesses, and disagreements are brought to the surface and thoughtfully discussed, or one in which they are not forthrightly brought to the surface and discussed?\n", "\u2022 One in which the right to criticize is nonhierarchical, or one in which it primarily comes from the top down?\n", "\u2022 One in which objective pictures of what people are like are derived through lots of data and broad triangulations of people, or one in which evaluations of people are more arbitrary?\n", "\u2022 One in which the organization pursues very high standards for achieving both meaningful work and meaningful relationships, or one in which work quality and relationship quality are not equally valued and/or the standards aren\u2019t as high?\n", "Which kind of organization do you think will enable better development for the people who work there, foster deeper relationships between them, and produce better results? Which approach would you prefer to see the leaders and organizations that you deal with follow? Which way of being would you prefer the people who run our government to follow?\n", "My bet is that after reading this book, you will agree that our way of operating is far more sensible than conventional ways of operating. But remember that my most fundamental principle is that you have to think for yourself.\n", "WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK AND HOW YOU CAN GET THE MOST OUT OF IT\n", "If you are inside Bridgewater, I am passing these principles on in my own words so that you can see the dream and the approach through my eyes. Bridgewater will evolve from where it is now based on what you and others in the next generation of leadership want and how you go about getting it. This book is intended to help you. How you use it is up to you. Whether or not this culture continues is up to you and those who succeed me in the leadership role. It is my responsibility to not be attached to Bridgewater being the way I would want it to be. It is most important that you and others who succeed me make your own independent choices. Like a parent with adult children, I want you all to be strong, independent thinkers who will do well without me. I have done my best to bring you to this point; now is the time for you to step up and for me to fade away.\n", "If you are outside Bridgewater and thinking about how these principles might apply to your organization, this book is meant to prompt your thinking, not to give you an exact formula to follow. You don\u2019t have to adopt all or any of these principles, though I do recommend that you consider them all. Many people who run other organizations have adopted some of these principles, modified others, and rejected many. Whatever you want to do with them is fine with me. These principles provide a framework you can modify to suit your needs. Maybe you will pursue the same goal and maybe you won\u2019t; chances are that, in either case, you will collect some valuable stuff. If you share my goal of having your organization be a real idea meritocracy, I believe this book will be invaluable for you because I\u2019m told that no organization has thought through or pushed the concepts of how to make a real idea meritocracy as far as Bridgewater. If doing that is important to you and you pursue it with unwavering determination you will encounter your own barriers, you will find your own ways around them, and you will get there, even if imperfectly.\n", "While these principles are good general rules, it\u2019s important to remember that every rule has exceptions and that no set of rules can ever substitute for common sense. Think of these principles as being like a GPS. A GPS helps you get where you\u2019re going, but if you follow it blindly off a bridge\u2014well, that would be your fault, not the GPS\u2019s. And just as a GPS that gives bad directions can be fixed by updating its software, it\u2019s important to raise and discuss exceptions to the principles as they occur so they can evolve and improve over time.\n", "No matter what path you choose to follow, your organization is a machine made up of culture and people that will interact to produce outcomes, and those outcomes will provide feedback about how well your organization is working. Learning from this feedback should lead you to modify the culture and the people so your organizational machine improves.\n", "This dynamic is so important that I\u2019ve organized Work Principles around it in three sections: To Get the Culture Right, To Get the People Right, and To Build and Evolve Your Machine. Each chapter within these sections begins with a higher-level principle. Reading these will give you a good sense of the main concepts in each chapter.\n", "Under these higher-level principles there are a number of supporting principles built around the many different types of decisions that need to be made. These principles are meant for reference. Though you might want to skim through them, I recommend using them as one would use an encyclopedia or search engine to answer a specific question. For example, if you have to fire (or transfer) someone, you should use the Table of Principles and go to the section of principles about that. To make this easier, at Bridgewater we created a tool called the \u201cCoach\u201d that allows people to type in their particular issue and find the appropriate principles to help them with it.\n", "My main objective is not to sell you on these principles but to share the most valuable lessons I\u2019ve learned over my more than forty-year journey. My goal is to get you to think hard about the tough tradeoffs that you will face in many types of situations. By thinking about the tradeoffs behind the principles, you will be able to decide for yourself which principles are best for you.\n", "This brings me to my most fundamental work principle:\n", "\u2022 Make your passion and your work one and the same and do it with people you want to be with.\n", "Work is either 1) a job you do to earn the money to pay for the life you want to have or 2) what you do to achieve your mission, or some mix of the two. I urge you to make it as much 2) as possible, recognizing the value of 1). If you do that, most everything will go better than if you don\u2019t.\n", "Work Principles is written for those for whom work is primarily the game that you play to follow your passion and achieve your mission.\n", "TO GET THE CULTURE RIGHT . . .\n", "You have to work in a culture that suits you. That\u2019s fundamental to your happiness and your effectiveness. You also must work in a culture that is effective in producing great outcomes, because if you don\u2019t, you won\u2019t get the psychic and material rewards that keep you motivated. In this section on culture I will share my thoughts on how to match your culture to your needs, and I will explain the type of culture that I wanted and that has worked so well for me: an idea meritocracy.\n", "In Chapter One, I explain what an idea meritocracy looks like, and explore why radical truth and radical transparency are essential for it to work well. Being radically truthful and radically transparent are probably the most difficult principles to internalize, because they are so different from what most people are used to. Because this way of being is frequently misunderstood, I tried especially hard to be crystal clear in conveying why we operate this way and how it works in practice.\n", "In Chapter Two, we will turn our attention to why and how to build a culture that fosters meaningful relationships. Besides being rewarding themselves, meaningful relationships enable the radical truth and transparency that allow us to hold each other accountable for producing excellence.\n", "I believe that great cultures, like great people, recognize that making mistakes is part of the process of learning, and that continuous learning is what allows an organization to evolve successfully over time. In Chapter Three, we will explore the principles for doing that well.\n", "Of course, an idea meritocracy is based on the belief that pulling people\u2019s thinking together and stress-testing it produces better outcomes than when people keep their disparate thoughts in their own heads. Chapter Four contains principles for \u201cgetting in sync\u201d well. Knowing how to have thoughtful disagreements is key.\n", "Idea meritocracies carefully weigh the merits of its members\u2019 opinions. Since many opinions are bad and virtually everyone is confident that theirs are good, the process of being able to sort through them well is important to understand. Chapter Five explains our system for believability-weighted decision making.\n", "Since disagreements sometimes remain even after decisions are made, one also needs principles for resolving them that are clearly communicated, consistently adhered to, and universally recognized as fair. I go over these in Chapter Six.\n", "MAKE YOUR IDEA MERITOCRACY WORK IN A WAY THAT SUITS YOU\n", "While all of what you read here may seem challenging and complicated in practice, if you believe as I do that there is no better way to make decisions than to have believable people open-mindedly and assertively surface, explore, and resolve their differences, then you will figure out what it takes to operate that way. If an idea meritocracy doesn\u2019t work well, the fault doesn\u2019t lie in the concept; it lies in people not valuing it enough to make sure that it works.\n", "If you take nothing else away from this book, you owe it to yourself to see what it\u2019s like to experience an idea meritocracy. If it makes sense to you, I hope you will take the plunge. It won\u2019t take long for you to understand what a radical difference it will make to your work and your relationships.\n", "To have an Idea Meritocracy:\n", "1) Put your honest thoughts on the table\n", "2) Have thoughtful disagreement\n", "3) Abide by agreed-upon ways of getting past disagreement\n", "1 Trust in Radical Truth and Radical Transparency\n", "Understanding what is true is essential for success, and being radically transparent about everything, including mistakes and weaknesses, helps create the understanding that leads to improvements. That\u2019s not just a theory; we have put this into practice at Bridgewater for over forty years, so we know how it works. But like most things in life, being radically truthful and transparent has cons as well as pros, which I will describe as accurately as possible in this chapter.\n", "Being radically truthful and transparent with your colleagues and expecting your colleagues to be the same with you ensures that important issues are apparent instead of hidden. It also enforces good behavior and good thinking, because when you have to explain yourself, everyone can openly assess the merits of your logic. If you are handling things well, radical transparency will make that clear, and if you are handling things badly, radical transparency will make that clear as well, so it helps to maintain high standards.\n", "Radical truth and radical transparency are fundamental to having a real idea meritocracy. The more people can see what is happening\u2014the good, the bad, and the ugly\u2014the more effective they are at deciding the appropriate ways of handling things. This approach is also invaluable for training: Learning is compounded and accelerated when everyone has the opportunity to hear what everyone else is thinking. As a leader, you will get the feedback essential for your learning and for the continual improvement of the organization\u2019s decision-making rules. And seeing firsthand what\u2019s happening and why builds trust and allows people to make the independent assessments of the evidence that a functioning idea meritocracy requires.\n", "ADAPTING TO RADICAL TRUTH AND RADICAL TRANSPARENCY\n", "It takes getting used to. Virtually everyone who joins Bridgewater believes intellectually that radical truth and radical transparency are what they want, because, after careful thought, that\u2019s what they signed up for. Yet most find it difficult to adjust to it because they struggle with the \u201ctwo yous\u201d as explained in Understand That People Are Wired Very Differently. While their \u201cupper-level yous\u201d understand the benefits of it, their \u201clower-level yous\u201d tend to react with a flight-or-fight response. Adapting typically takes about eighteen months, though it varies from individual to individual, and there are those who never successfully adapt to it.\n", "Some people tell me it\u2019s inconsistent with human nature to operate this way\u2014that people need to be protected from harsh truths and that such a system could never work in practice. Our experience\u2014and our success\u2014have proven that wrong. While it\u2019s true that our way of being is not what most people are used to, that doesn\u2019t make it unnatural, any more than the hard physical exercise athletes and soldiers do is unnatural. It is a fundamental law of nature that you get stronger only by doing difficult things. While our idea meritocracy is not for everyone, for those who do adapt to it\u2014which is about two-thirds of those who try it\u2014it is so liberating and effective that it\u2019s hard for them to imagine any other way to be. What most people like best is knowing there is no spin.\n", "RADICAL TRUTH AND TRANSPARENCY IN PRACTICE\n", "To give you an idea of what radical truth and transparency look like, I\u2019ll share a difficult situation we faced a few years ago when our Management Committee began thinking about reorganizing our back office. Our back office provides the services we need to support our trading in the markets, including trade confirmations, settlements, record maintenance, and accounting. We had built this team up over many years and it was full of hardworking, close-knit employees who were part of our extended family. But at the time we were seeing a need for new capacities that would stretch us beyond what we could do in-house. This led our COO, Eileen Murray, to devise an innovative strategy for spinning off this team and having them incorporated into a tailor-made group within the Bank of New York/Mellon. It was just an exploratory conversation at first; we had no idea whether we would pursue it, how we would pursue it, or what that would ultimately mean for the members of our back office team.\n", "Put yourself in the shoes of the Management Committee. When would you tell the back office team that you were thinking of spinning off their group into another company? Would you wait until the picture was clear? In most organizations this kind of strategic decision would typically be kept under wraps until it was a done deal, because bosses generally think it\u2019s bad to create uncertainty among employees. We believe the opposite: that the only responsible way to operate is truthfully and transparently, so that people know what\u2019s really going on and can help us sort through any issues that arise. In this case, Eileen led a town-hall meeting with the back office team right away. In the way typical of leaders at Bridgewater, she explained that there was a lot she didn\u2019t know and there were a lot of questions that she wouldn\u2019t be able to answer. This was the harsh reality at that moment, and while it did create uncertainty, had she followed the more traditional approach of being less open, the inevitable rumors and speculation would\u2019ve made things much worse.\n", "Though the group ultimately did get spun off, we continue to have wonderful relationships with the people in it. Not only did they cooperate fully throughout the transition, they still come to our Christmas and Fourth of July parties and remain a part of our extended family. Today, we have an award-winning back office because of the innovative things this change allowed us to do. Most importantly, since we were operating openly even while we hadn\u2019t figured things out, the back office team had their confidence in our truthfulness and consideration for them reinforced, and they returned it in kind.\n", "For me, not telling people what\u2019s really going on so as to protect them from the worries of life is like letting your kids grow into adulthood believing in the Tooth Fairy or Santa Claus. While concealing the truth might make people happier in the short run, it won\u2019t make them smarter or more trusting in the long run. It\u2019s a real asset that people know they can trust what we say. For that reason I believe that it\u2019s almost always better to shoot straight, even when you don\u2019t have all the answers or when there\u2019s bad news to convey. As Winston Churchill said, \u201cThere is no worse course in leadership than to hold out false hopes soon to be swept away.\u201d People need to face harsh and uncertain realities if they are going to learn how to deal with them\u2014and you\u2019ll learn a lot about the people around you by seeing how well they do.\n"], "Realize that you have nothing to fear from knowing the truth.": ["Realize that you have nothing to fear from knowing the truth.\n", "If you\u2019re like most people, the idea of facing the unvarnished truth makes you anxious.

As scary as the truth may turn out to be, you will be better off knowing it in the long run because it will allow you to seek the most appropriate treatment. The same holds for learning painful truths about your own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing and acting on the truth is what we call the \u201cbig deal\u201d at Bridgewater.

While presenting your view as something other than it is can sometimes be easier in the moment (because you can avoid conflict, or embarrassment, or achieve some other short-term goal), the second- and third-order effects of having integrity and avoiding duality are immense. People who are one way on the inside and another on the outside become conflicted and often lose touch with their own values. It\u2019s difficult for them to be happy and almost impossible for them to be their best.\n", "Aligning what you say with what you think and what you think with what you feel will make you much happier and much more successful. Thinking solely about what\u2019s accurate instead of how it is perceived pushes you to focus on the most important things. It helps you sort through people and places because you\u2019ll be drawn to people and places that are open and honest. It\u2019s also fairer to those around you: Making judgments about people so that they are tried and sentenced in your head, without asking for their perspective, is both unethical and unproductive. Having nothing to hide relieves stress and builds trust.\n", "a. Never say anything about someone that you wouldn\u2019t say to them directly and don\u2019t try people without accusing them to their faces. Criticism is welcomed and encouraged at Bridgewater, but there is never a good reason to bad-mouth people behind their backs. It is counterproductive and shows a serious lack of integrity, it doesn\u2019t yield any beneficial change, and it subverts both the person being badmouthed and the environment as a whole. Next to being dishonest, it is the worst thing you can do in our community.\n", "Managers should not talk about people who work for them if they are not in the room.

I have regularly seen people kept in jobs that they don\u2019t deserve because of their personal relationship to the boss, and this leads to unscrupulous managers trading on personal loyalties to build fiefdoms for themselves. Judging one person by a different set of rules than another is an insidious form of corruption that undermines the meritocracy.\n", "I believe in a healthier form of loyalty founded on openly exploring what is true. Explicit, principled thinking and radical transparency are the best antidotes for self-dealing. When everyone is held to the same principles and decision making is done publicly, it is difficult for people to pursue their own interests at the expense of the organization\u2019s. In such an environment, those who face their challenges have the most admirable character; when mistakes and weaknesses are hidden, unhealthy character is rewarded instead.\n"], "Create an environment in which everyone has the right to understand what makes sense and no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up.": ["Create an environment in which everyone has the right to understand what makes sense and no one has the right to hold a critical opinion without speaking up.\n", "Whether people have the independence and character to fight for the best answers will depend upon their nature, but you can encourage them by creating an atmosphere in which everyone\u2019s first thought is to ask: \u201cIs it true?\u201d\n", "a. Speak up, own it, or get out. In an idea meritocracy, openness is a responsibility; you not only have the privilege to speak up and \u201cfight for right\u201d but are obliged to do so.

For example, don\u2019t believe most people who are caught being dishonest when they say that they\u2019ve seen the light and will never do it again because chances are they will. Dishonest people are dangerous, so keeping them around isn\u2019t smart.\n", "At the same time, let\u2019s be practical.

While I have extremely high standards when it comes to integrity, I don\u2019t view it in a black-white, one-strike-and-you\u2019re-out way. I look at the severity, the circumstances, and the patterns to try to understand whether I am dealing with a person who is a habitual liar and will lie to me again, or with a person who is fundamentally honest yet imperfect. I consider the significance of the dishonesty itself (Was the person stealing a piece of cake or were they committing a felony?) as well as the nature of our existing relationship (Is it my spouse telling the lie, a casual acquaintance, or an employee?). Treating such cases differently is appropriate because a basic law of justice is that the punishment should fit the crime.\n"], "Be radically transparent.": ["Be radically transparent.\n", "If you agree that a real idea meritocracy is an extremely powerful thing, it should not be a great leap for you to see that giving people the right to see things for themselves is better than forcing them to rely on information processed for them by others. Radical transparency forces issues to the surface\u2014most importantly (and most uncomfortably) the problems that people are dealing with and how they\u2019re dealing with them\u2014and it allows the organization to draw on the talents and insights of all its members to solve them. Eventually, for people who get used to it, living in a culture of radical transparency is more comfortable than living in the fog of not knowing what\u2019s going on and not knowing what people really think. And it is incredibly effective. But, to be clear, like most great things it also has drawbacks. Its biggest drawback is that it is initially very difficult for most people to deal with uncomfortable realities. If unmanaged, it can lead to people getting involved with more things than they should, and can lead people who aren\u2019t able to weigh all the information to draw the wrong conclusions.\n", "For example, bringing all an organization\u2019s problems to the surface and regarding every one of them as intolerable may lead some people to wrongly conclude that their organization has more intolerable problems than another organization that keeps its issues under wraps. Yet which organization is more likely to achieve excellence? One that highlights its problems and considers them intolerable or one that doesn\u2019t?\n", "Don\u2019t get me wrong: Radical transparency isn\u2019t the same as total transparency. It just means much more transparency than is typical. We do keep some things confidential, such as private health matters or deeply personal problems, sensitive details about intellectual property or security issues, the timing of a major trade, and at least for the short term, matters that are likely to be distorted, sensationalized, and harmfully misunderstood if leaked to the press. In the following principles, you will get a good explanation of when and why we\u2019ve found it helpful to be transparent and when and why we\u2019ve found it inappropriate.\n", "Frankly, when I started off being so radically transparent, I had no idea how it would go; I just knew that it was extremely important and that I had to fight hard and find ways to make it happen. I pushed the limits and was surprised by how well it worked. For example, when I started taping all our meetings our lawyers told us we were crazy because we were creating evidence that could be used against us in court or by regulators such as the SEC. In response, I theorized that radical transparency would reduce the risk of our doing anything wrong\u2014and of not dealing appropriately with our mistakes\u2014and that the tapes would in fact protect us. If we were handling things well, our transparency would make that clear (provided, of course, that all parties are reasonable, which isn\u2019t something you can always take for granted), and if we were handling things badly, our transparency would ensure that we would get what we deserve, which, in the long run, would be good for us.\n", "I didn\u2019t know for sure at the time, but our experience has proven this theory correct time and again. Bridgewater has had uncommonly few legal or regulatory encounters, largely because of our radical transparency. That\u2019s because it\u2019s tougher to do bad things and easier to find out what\u2019s true and resolve claims through radical transparency. Over the last several decades, we have not had a single material legal or regulatory judgment against us.\n", "Naturally, growing bigger and more successful attracts more media attention, and reporters know that salacious and controversial stories draw more eyeballs than balanced ones. Bridgewater is especially vulnerable to this kind of reporting because, with our culture of bringing problems to the surface and sharing them transparently within the company, we leave ourselves open to leaks. Would it be better not to be transparent and so avoid such problems?\n", "I\u2019ve learned that the people whose opinions matter most are those who know us best\u2014our clients and our employees\u2014and that our radical transparency serves us well with them. Not only has it led to our producing better results, but it also builds trust with our employees and clients so that mischaracterizations in the press roll off their backs. When we discuss such situations with them, they say that for us to not operate transparently would scare them much more.\n", "Having this sort of understanding and support to do the right things has been immeasurably valuable. But we wouldn\u2019t have known about these great payoffs if we hadn\u2019t so steadfastly pushed the limits of this truth and transparency.\n", "a. Use transparency to help enforce justice. When everyone can follow the discussion leading up to a decision\u2014either in real time in person or via taped records and email threads\u2014justice is more likely to prevail. Everyone is held accountable for their thinking and anyone can weigh in on who should do what according to shared principles. Absent such a transparent process, decisions would be settled behind closed doors by those who have the power to do whatever they want. With transparency, everyone is held to the same high standards.\n", "b. Share the things that are hardest to share. While it might be tempting to limit transparency to the things that can\u2019t hurt you, it is especially important to share the things that are most difficult to share, because if you don\u2019t share them you will lose the trust and partnership of the people you are not sharing with. So, when faced with the decision to share the hardest things, the question should not be whether to share but how. The following principles will help you do this well.\n", "c. Keep exceptions to radical transparency very rare. While I would like virtually total transparency and wish that everyone would handle the information they have access to responsibly to work out what\u2019s true and what to do about it, I realize that\u2019s an ideal to be approached but never fully achieved. There are exceptions to every rule, and in very rare cases, it is better not to be radically transparent. In those unusual cases, you will need to figure out a way that preserves the culture of radical transparency without exposing you and those you care about to undue risks.\n", "When weighing an exception, approach it as an expected value calculation, taking into consideration the second- and third-order consequences. Ask yourself whether the costs of making the case transparent and managing the risks of that transparency outweigh the benefits. In the vast majority of cases, they don\u2019t. I\u2019ve found that the most common reasons to limit broad transparency are:\n", "1. Where the information is of a private, personal, or confidential nature and doesn\u2019t meaningfully impact the community at large.\n", "2. Where sharing and managing such information puts the long-term interests of the Bridgewater community, its clients, and our ability to uphold our principles at risk (for instance, our proprietary investment logic or a legal dispute).\n", "3. Where the value of sharing the information broadly with the community is very low and the distraction it would cause would be significant (compensation, for instance).\n", "What I\u2019m saying is that I believe one should push the limits of being transparent while remaining prudent. Because we tape virtually everything\u2014including our mistakes and weaknesses\u2014for everyone to see, we are a target-rich environment for media that thrives on sensationalistic or critical gossip and can find ways of having information leaked to them. In one case when we faced the problem of having information leaked to the press that was intentionally distorted and hurt our recruiting efforts, we were forced to institute some controls on ultrasensitive information, so that only a significant number of ultratrustworthy people received it in real time, and it was distributed to others after a delay. The information was the sort that, in a typical company, would be shared with just a handful but at Bridgewater was shared with nearly a hundred trusted people. In other words, while our radical transparency in that case wasn\u2019t total, I pushed its limits in a practical way. It served us well because the people who most needed the transparency got it right away and most everyone understood that the commitment to being transparent remained very much intact, even in challenging circumstances. People know that my intent is to always push the limits of trying to be transparent and that the only things that would prevent me from doing that will be the interests of the company and that I will tell them if I can\u2019t be transparent and why. It is in our culture to be that way and that fosters trust, even when the transparency is less than we would like it to be.\n", "d. Make sure those who are given radical transparency recognize their responsibilities to handle it well and to weigh things intelligently.\n", "People cannot be given the privilege of receiving information and then use the information to harm the company, so rules and procedures must be in place to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen. For example, we provide great transparency inside Bridgewater on the condition that Bridgewater citizens do not leak it outside; if they do, they will be dismissed for cause (for unethical behavior). Additionally, the rules for how issues are explored and decisions are made must be maintained, and because different people have different perspectives, it\u2019s important that the paths for resolving them are followed. For example, some people are going to make big deals out of little deals, come up with their own wrong theories, or have problems seeing how things are evolving. Remind them of the risks that the company takes to give them that transparency and their responsibilities to handle the information that they get responsibly. I have found that people appreciating this transparency and knowing that they will lose it if it is not handled well leads them to enforce good behavior with each other.\n", "e. Provide transparency to people who handle it well and either deny it to people who don\u2019t handle it well or remove those people from the organization. It is the right and responsibility of management, and not the right of all employees, to determine when exceptions to radical transparency should be made.

If the overwhelming majority of people care about having an excellent community, they will take care of it, which will yield both better work and better relationships. Relationships have to be genuine, not forced; at the same time, the culture of the community will have a big influence on how people value relationships and how they behave with each other. To me, a meaningful relationship is one in which people care enough about each other to be there whenever someone needs support and they enjoy each other\u2019s company so much that they can have great times together both inside and outside of work. I literally love many of the people I work with, and I respect them deeply.\n", "I have often been asked whether relationships at Bridgewater are more like those of a family or those of a team, the implication being that in a family there is unconditional love and a permanent relationship, while in a team the attachment is only as strong as the person\u2019s contribution. Before answering this question, I want to emphasize that either is good by me, because both families and teams provide meaningful relationships and that neither is anything like a typical job at a typical company, where the relationships are primarily utilitarian. But to answer the question directly, I wanted Bridgewater to be like a family business in which family members have to perform excellently or be cut. If I had a family business and a family member wasn\u2019t performing well, I would want to let them go because I believe that it isn\u2019t good for either the family member (because staying in a job they\u2019re not suited to stands in the way of their personal evolution) or the company (because it holds back the whole community). That\u2019s tough love.\n", "To give you an idea of how Bridgewater\u2019s culture developed and how it\u2019s different from what you\u2019d find at most companies, I will tell you about how we handled benefits in our early days. When the company was just me and a small group of people, I didn\u2019t provide employees with health insurance; I assumed that they would buy it on their own. But I did want to help the people I shared my life with during their times of need. If someone I worked with got seriously sick and couldn\u2019t afford proper care, what was I going to do, stand by and not help them? Of course I\u2019d help them financially, to whatever extent I could. So when I did begin providing health insurance to my employees, I felt that I was insuring myself against the money I knew I\u2019d give them if they were injured or fell ill as much as I was insuring them.\n", "Because I wanted to make certain that they received the best care possible, the policies I provided allowed them to go to any doctor they chose and spend whatever amount was required. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t protect them against the little things. For example, I didn\u2019t provide dental insurance any more than I provided car insurance, because I felt that it was their own responsibility to protect their teeth, just as it was their own responsibility to take care of their car. If they needed dental insurance, they could pay for it out of their own pocket. My main point is that I didn\u2019t approach benefits in the impersonal, transactional way most companies do, but more like something I provided for my family. I was more than generous with some things and expected people to take personal responsibility for others.\n", "When I treated my employees like extended family, I found that they typically behaved the same way with each other and our community as a whole, which was much more special than having a strictly quid pro quo relationship. I can\u2019t tell you how many people would do anything in their power to help our community/company and wouldn\u2019t want to work anywhere else. This is invaluable.\n", "As Bridgewater grew, my ability to have quality personal contact with everyone faded, but this wasn\u2019t a problem because the broader community embraced this way of being with each other. This didn\u2019t just happen; we did a lot to help it along. For example, we put into place a policy that we would pay for half of practically any activities that people want to do together up to a set cap (we now support more than a hundred clubs and athletic and common-interest groups); we paid for food and drink for those who hosted potluck dinners at their houses; and we bought a house that employees can use for events and celebrations. We have Christmas, Halloween, Fourth of July, and other parties that often include family members. Eventually, others who valued this kind of relationship took responsibility for it and it spread to become a cultural norm so that I could just sit back and watch beauty happen.\n", "What about the person who doesn\u2019t give a damn about all of this meaningful relationship stuff, who just wants to go into work, do a good job, and receive fair compensation? Is that okay? Sure it is, and it\u2019s common for a significant percentage of employees. Not everyone feels the same or is expected to feel the same about the community. It\u2019s totally okay to opt out. We have all sorts of people and respect whatever they want to do on their own time, as long as they abide by the law and are considerate. But these are not the folks who will provide the community with the skeletal strength of commitment that is essential for it to be extraordinary over very long periods of time.\n", "No matter how much one tries to create a culture of meaningful relationships, the organization is bound to have some bad (intentionally harmful) people in it.

Make sure people give more consideration to others than they demand for themselves. This is a requirement.\n", "Being considerate means allowing other people to mostly do what they want, so long as it is consistent with our principles, policies, and the law. It also means being willing to put others ahead of your own desires. If the people on both sides of an argument approach their disagreements in this way, we will have many fewer disputes about who is offending whom.\n", "Still, judgments will have to be made and lines will have to be drawn and set down in policies.\n", "This is the overarching guideline: It is more inconsiderate to prevent people from exercising their rights because you are offended by them than it is for them to do whatever it is that offends you. That said, it is inconsiderate not to weigh the impact of one\u2019s actions on others, so we expect people to use sensible judgment in not doing obviously offensive things. There are some behaviors that are clearly offensive to many people, and it is appropriate to specify and prohibit them in clear policies. The list of those specifics, and the policies pertaining to them, arise from specific cases. Applying this principle to them is done in much the same way that case law is created.\n", "b. Make sure that people understand the difference between fairness and generosity. Sometimes people mistake generosity for not being fair. For example, when Bridgewater arranged for a bus to shuttle people who live in New York City to our Connecticut office, one employee asked, \u201cIt seems it would be fair to also compensate those of us who spend hundreds of dollars on gas each month, particularly in light of the New York City bus.\u201d This line of thinking mistakes an act of generosity for some for an entitlement for everyone.\n", "Fairness and generosity are different things. If you bought two birthday gifts for two of your closest friends, and one cost more than the other, what would you say if the friend who got the cheaper gift accused you of being unfair? Probably something like, \u201cI didn\u2019t have to get you any gift, so stop complaining.\u201d At Bridgewater, we are generous with people (and I am personally generous), but we feel no obligation to be measured and equal in our generosity.\n", "Generosity is good and entitlement is bad, and they can easily be confused, so be crystal clear on which is which. Decisions should be based on what you believe is warranted in a particular circumstance and what will be most appreciated. If you want to have a community of people who have both high-quality, long-term relationships and a high sense of personal responsibility, you can\u2019t allow a sense of entitlement to creep in.\n", "c. Know where the line is and be on the far side of fair. The line is what\u2019s fair, appropriate, or required, as distinct from what\u2019s generous, in light of the defined quid pro quo relationship between parties. As mentioned earlier, you should expect people to behave in a manner consistent with how people in high-quality, long-term relationships behave\u2014with a high level of mutual consideration for each other\u2019s interests and a clear understanding of who is responsible for what. Each should operate on the far side of fair, by which I mean giving more consideration to others than you demand for yourself. This is different from how people in most commercial relationships generally behave, as they tend to focus more on their own interests than on the interests of others or of the community as a whole. If each party says \u201cYou deserve more,\u201d \u201cNo, you deserve more,\u201d rather than \u201cI deserve more,\u201d you are more likely to have generous, good relationships.\n", "d. Pay for work. While it isn\u2019t all about the quid pro quo between the company and the employee, this balance must be economically viable for the relationships to be sustainable. Set policies that clearly define this quid pro quo, and be measured, but not excessively precise, when shifting it around. While you should by and large stick to the arrangement, you should also recognize that there are rare, special times when employees will need a bit of extra time off and there are times that the company will require employees to give it extra hours. The company should pay for above-normal work one way or another, and employees should be docked for below-normal work. The give-and-take should roughly equal out over time. Within reasonable boundaries, nobody should worry about the exact ebbs and flows.

It was terrible and I could easily have fired Ross to make the point that nothing less than perfection will be accepted. But that would have been counterproductive. I would have lost a good man and it would have only encouraged other employees to hide their mistakes, creating a culture that would not only be dishonest but crippled in its ability to learn and grow.

If they\u2019re not, the process of sorting through disagreements and knowing who has the authority to decide quickly becomes chaotic. Sometimes people get angry or stuck; a conversation can easily wind up with two or more people spinning unproductively and unable to reach agreement on what to do.\n", "For these reasons, specific processes and procedures must be followed. Every party to the discussion must understand who has what rights and which procedures should be followed to move toward resolution.

And everyone must understand the most fundamental principle for getting in sync, which is that people must be open-minded and assertive at the same time. Thoughtful disagreement is not a battle; its goal is not to convince the other party that he or she is wrong and you are right, but to find out what is true and what to do about it. It must also be nonhierarchical, because in an idea meritocracy communication doesn\u2019t just flow unquestioned from the top down.

Greg disagreed, asserting that he was simply reminding the employee of relevant principles and her responsibilities to either adhere to them or openly question them. The two sought to get in sync through a series of emails, and when that didn\u2019t work, they raised their disagreement to the Management Committee. A case based on the meeting in question was sent to the entire company so everyone could judge for themselves who was right and who was wrong.

We used it to reflect on our written principles for handling situations like this and they both got a lot of useful feedback.

Make clear what type of communication you are going to have in light of the objectives and priorities. If your goal is to have people with different opinions work through their differences to try to get closer to what is true and what to do about it (open-minded debate), you will run your meeting differently than if its goal is to educate. Debating takes time, and that time increases exponentially depending on the number of people participating in the discussion, so you have to carefully choose the right people in the right numbers to suit the decision that needs to be made. In any discussion try to limit the participation to those whom you value most in light of your objectives. The worst way to pick people is based on whether their conclusions align with yours.

That is because 1) the marginal benefits diminish as the group gets larger (two or three people might be able to cover most of the important perspectives, so adding more people doesn\u2019t bring much more) and 2) larger group interactions are less efficient than smaller ones. Of course, what\u2019s best in practice depends on the quality of the people and the differences of the perspectives that they bring and how well the group is managed.\n"], "When you have alignment, cherish it.": ["When you have alignment, cherish it.\n", "While there is nobody in the world who will share your point of view on everything, there are people who will share your most important values and the ways in which you choose to live them out.

Both systems produce inferior decision making. That\u2019s because the best decisions are made by an idea meritocracy with believability-weighted decision making, in which the most capable people work through their disagreements with other capable people who have thought independently about what is true and what to do about it.\n", "It is far better to weight the opinions of more capable decision makers more heavily than those of less capable decision makers. This is what we mean by \u201cbelievability weighting.\u201d So how do you determine who is capable at what? The most believable opinions are those of people who 1) have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question, and 2) have demonstrated that they can logically explain the cause-effect relationships behind their conclusions. When believability weighting is done correctly and consistently, it is the fairest and the most effective decision-making system. It not only produces the best outcomes but also preserves alignment, since even people who disagree with the decision will be able to get behind it.\n", "But for this to be the case, the criteria for establishing believability must be objective and trusted by everybody. At Bridgewater everyone\u2019s believability is tracked and measured systematically, using tools such as Baseball Cards and the Dot Collector that actively record and weigh their experience and track records. In meetings we regularly take votes about various issues via our Dot Collector app, which displays both the equal-weighted average and the believability-weighted results (along with each person\u2019s vote).\n", "Typically, if both the equal-weighted average and the believability- weighted votes align, we consider the matter resolved and move on. If the two types of votes are at odds, we try again to resolve them and, if we can\u2019t, we go with the believability-weighted vote. Depending on what type of decision it is, in some cases, a single \u201cResponsible Party\u201d (RP) can override a believability-weighted vote; in others, the believability-weighted vote supersedes the RP\u2019s decision. But in all cases believability-weighted votes are taken seriously when there is disagreement. Even in cases in which the RPs can overrule the believability- weighted vote, the onus is on the RP to try to resolve the dispute before overruling it. In my forty years at Bridgewater, I never made a decision contrary to the believability-weighted decision because I felt that to do so was arrogant and counter to the spirit of the idea meritocracy, though I argued like hell for what I thought was best.\n", "To give you an example of what this process looks like in action, during the spring of 2012 our research teams used believability- weighted decision making to resolve a disagreement about what would happen next as the European debt crisis was heating up. At that time, the borrowing and debt-service needs of the governments of Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, and especially Spain had reached levels that far exceeded their abilities to pay. We knew that the European Central Bank would either have to make unprecedented purchases of government bonds or allow the debt crisis to worsen to the point where defaults and the breakup of the Eurozone would probably occur. Germany was adamantly opposed to a bailout. It was clear that the fates of these countries\u2019 economies, and of the Eurozone itself, depended on how well Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, orchestrated the ECB\u2019s next move. But what would he do?\n", "Like analyzing a chess board to visualize the implications and inclinations of the different moves of the different players, each of us looked at the situation from every angle. After a lot of discussion we remained split: About half of us thought the ECB would print more money to buy the bonds and about half thought they wouldn\u2019t, because breaking with the Germans would threaten the Eurozone even more. While such thoughtful and open exchanges are essential, it\u2019s also critical to have mutually agreed-upon ways of resolving them to arrive at the best decision. So we used our believability-weighting system to break the stalemate.\n", "We did that using our Dot Collector tool, which helps us surface the sources of our disagreements in people\u2019s different thinking characteristics and work our way through them based on their believabilities. People have different believability weightings for different qualities, like expertise in a particular subject, creativity, ability to synthesize, etc. These dots are determined by a mixture of ratings, both from peers and tests of different sorts. By looking at these attributes, and also understanding which thinking qualities are most essential to the situation at hand, we can make the best decisions.\n", "In this case, we took a believability-weighted vote, with the qualities chosen being both subject-matter expertise and ability to synthesize. Using the Dot Collector, it became clear that those with greater believability believed Draghi would defy Germany and print money, so that is what we went with. A few days later, European policymakers announced a sweeping plan to buy unlimited quantities of government bonds, so we got it right. While the believability-weighted answer isn\u2019t always the best answer, we have found that it is more likely to be right than either the boss\u2019s answer or an equal-weighted referendum.\n", "Regardless of whether or not you use this kind of technology and structured process for believability weighting, the most important thing is that you get the concept. Simply look down on yourself and your team when a decision needs to be made and consider who is most likely to be right.

Would it be helpful or harmful to the group\u2019s progress to ignore their different track records and experience? Of course it would be harmful and plain silly to treat their points of view equally, because they have different levels of believability. The most productive approach would be to allow Ruth to give his instructions uninterrupted and then take some time afterward to answer questions. But because I\u2019m pretty extreme in believing that it is important to obtain understanding rather than accepting doctrine at face value, I would encourage the new batter not to accept what Ruth has to say as right just because he was the greatest slugger of all time.

While everyone has the right and obligation to make sense of everything, basic rules for engagement should be followed. Those rules and how you should follow them depend on your relative believabilities. For example, it would not be effective for the person who knows less to tell the person who knows more how something should be done.

If you\u2019re more believable, your role is more of a teacher, primarily conveying your understanding and answering questions. And if you are approximate peers, you should have a thoughtful exchange as equals. When there is a disagreement about who is more believable, be reasonable and work it through.

It\u2019s more important that the student understand the teacher than that the teacher understand the student, though both are important. I have often seen less believable people (students) insist that the more believable people (teachers) understand their thinking and prove why the teacher is wrong before listening to what the teacher (the more believable party) has to say. That\u2019s backward. While untangling the student\u2019s thinking can be helpful, it is typically difficult and time-consuming and puts the emphasis on what the student sees instead of on what the teacher wants to convey. For that reason, our protocol is for the student to be open-minded first. Once the student has taken in what the teacher has to offer, both student and teacher will be better prepared to untangle and explore the student\u2019s perspective. It is also more time-efficient to get in sync this way, which leads to the next principle.\n", "b. Recognize that while everyone has the right and responsibility to try to make sense of important things, they must do so with humility and radical open-mindedness. When you are less believable, start by taking on the role of a student in a student-teacher relationship\u2014with appropriate humility and open-mindedness. While it is not necessarily you who doesn\u2019t understand, you must assume this until you have seen the issue through the other\u2019s eyes.

If you still can\u2019t reach an agreement, assume you are wrong. If, on the other hand, you are able to convince a number of believable people of your point of view, then you should make sure your thinking is heard and considered by the person deciding, probably with the help of the other believable parties. Remember that those who are higher in the reporting hierarchy have more people they are trying to sort through on an expected value basis to get the best thinking and more people who want to tell them what they think, so they are time-constrained and have to play the probabilities. If your thinking has been stress-tested by other believable people who support you, it has a greater probability of being heard.

At the very beginning, we just hired people we liked. But too many of them turned out to be bad fits. Because we liked them, we were reluctant to give up on them, and things often went from bad to worse. So we started hiring like most companies do, by looking at r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, narrowing the lists, and then interviewing to get a gut feel for who was right. But the questions we asked our candidates, unlike the questions on a scientifically constructed personality test, were unlikely to elicit answers truly indicative of what they were like.\n", "What we were doing, essentially, was looking at prospective employees through our own biased perspectives. Those of us who were linear thinkers tended to want to hire linear thinkers; those of us who were lateral thinkers tended to want to hire lateral thinkers. We all thought the type we chose would perform best in all jobs, and as a result we weren\u2019t able to accurately predict who would succeed and who would fail in our very unusual environment. As a result, we continued to make a lot of bad hires.\n", "Eventually we learned from our mistakes and failures that we could improve our hiring results in two ways: 1) by always being crisp and clear on exactly what kind of person we were looking for, and 2) by developing our vocabulary for and means of evaluating people\u2019s abilities at a much more granular level. This chapter lays out in detail the principles we\u2019ve learned for doing this. While we still make too many hiring mistakes, we have significantly reduced the odds of making them by following these processes, which we continually try to improve.\n", "At a high level, we look for people who think independently, argue open-mindedly and assertively, and above all else value the intense pursuit of truth and excellence, and through it, the rapid improvement of themselves and the organization. Because we treat work as more than just what we do to make a living, we look at every potential hire not just as an employee but as someone we\u2019d want share our lives with. We insist that the people we work with are considerate and have a high sense of personal accountability to do the difficult, right things. We look for people with generous natures and high standards of fairness. Most important, they must be able to put their egos aside and assess themselves candidly.\n", "Whether you choose to look for these same traits or others, the most important thing you can do is understand that hiring is a high-risk gamble that needs to be approached deliberately. A lot of time, effort, and resources go into hiring and developing new employees before it\u2019s clear whether or not they are good fits. Months or even years and countless dollars can be wasted in training and retraining. Some of those costs are intangible, including loss of morale and a gradual diminishment of standards as people who aren\u2019t excellent in their roles bump into each other; other costs from bad outcomes can be measured all too easily in dollars and cents.

Some people are great learners and fast processors; others possess the ability to see things at a higher level. Some focus more on the particulars; still others think creatively or logically or with supreme organization. Skills are learned tools, such as being able to speak a foreign language or write computer code.

You need to make sure that each one of those steps is done more systematically and purposefully. For example, you should think through what questions are asked and how the different answers candidates give differentiate them in the ways that you are seeking to differentiate them. You should also save all of those answers so you can learn about how indicative they might be of subsequent behaviors and performance. I do not mean that the human dimension or art of the hiring process should be eliminated\u2014the personal values and esprit de corps part of a relationship are critically important and can\u2019t be fully measured by data.

While this process is generally difficult for both managers and their subordinates, in the long run it has made people happier and Bridgewater more successful.

So learning about your people\u2019s weaknesses is just as valuable (for them and for you) as is learning their strengths.\n", "Even as you help people develop, you must constantly assess whether they are able to fulfill their responsibilities excellently. This is not easy to do objectively since you will often have meaningful relationships with your reports and may be reluctant to evaluate them accurately if their performance isn\u2019t at the bar. By the same token, you may be tempted to give an employee who rubs you the wrong way a worse evaluation than he or she deserves. An idea meritocracy requires objectivity. Many of the management tools we have developed were built to do just that, providing us with an unbiased picture of people and their performance independent of the biases of any one manager. This data is essential in cases where a manager and a report are out of sync on an assessment and others are called in to resolve the dispute.\n", "A few years ago, one of our employees was serving in a trial role as a department head. The prior department head had left the firm, and Greg, who was then CEO, was assessing whether this employee, who had previously been a deputy, had the right abilities to step into the role. The employee thought he did; Greg and others thought he did not. But this decision was not as simple as the CEO \u201cmaking the call.\u201d We want decisions to be more evidence-based. As a result of our Dot Collector system of constant feedback, we had literally hundreds of data points on the specific attributes required for the job, including synthesis, knowing what he didn\u2019t know, and managing at the right level. So we put all this data onto the screen and stared hard at it together. We then asked the employee to look at that body of evidence and reflect on what he would do if he were in the position of deciding whether he\u2019d hire himself for the job.

Recognize that personal evolution should be relatively rapid and a natural consequence of discovering one\u2019s strengths and weaknesses; as a result, career paths are not planned at the outset. The evolutionary process is about discovering people\u2019s likes and dislikes as well as their strengths and weaknesses; it occurs when people are put into jobs they are likely to succeed at, but in which they have to stretch themselves. Each person\u2019s career will evolve based on what we all learn about what the person is like.\n", "They should be given enough freedom to learn and think for themselves while being coached so they are prevented from making unacceptable mistakes. The feedback they receive should help them reflect on whether their problems are the kind that can be resolved by additional learning or stem from natural abilities that are unlikely to change. Typically it takes from six to twelve months to get to know a new employee in a by-and-large sort of way, and about eighteen months for them to internalize and adapt to the culture. During this time there should be periodic mini-reviews and several major ones. Following each of these assessments, new assignments should be made that are tailored to their likes and dislikes and strengths and weaknesses. This is an iterative process, in which the accumulated experiences of training, testing, and adjusting direct the person to ever more suitable roles and responsibilities. At Bridgewater, it is typically both a challenging and rewarding process that benefits the individual by providing better self-understanding and greater familiarity with various jobs. When it results in a parting of ways, it\u2019s usually because people find they cannot be excellent and happy in any job at the firm.\n", "b. Understand that training guides the process of personal evolution.Trainees must be open-minded; the process requires them to suspend their egos while they discover what they are doing well and what they are doing poorly and decide what to do about it. The trainer must be open-minded as well, and it\u2019s best if at least two believable trainers work with each trainee in order to triangulate their views about what the trainee is like. This training is an apprentice relationship; it occurs as the trainer and trainee share experiences, much like when a ski instructor skis alongside his student.

It\u2019s also not a good thing for you as a manager. Instead of micromanaging, you should be training and testing.

Don\u2019t oversqueeze a dot. Remember: A dot is just a dot; what matters is how they add up. Think of each individual dot as an at-bat in baseball.

It\u2019s also hard to track progress. This is part of the reason I created the Dot Collector. I also recommend thinking about other ways that people\u2019s responsibilities can be put in metrics. One example: You can have people note whether they did or didn\u2019t do things on checklists, which you can then use to calculate what percentage of tasks they complete.

Do this on an ongoing basis. After several months of discussions and real-world tests, you and your report should both have a pretty good idea of what he or she is like. Over time this exercise will crystallize suitable roles and appropriate training or it will reveal that it\u2019s time for the person to find a more appropriate job somewhere else.\n", "a. Make your metrics clear and impartial. To help you build your perpetual motion machine, have a clear set of rules and a clear set of metrics to track how people are performing against those rules\u2014and predetermined consequences that are determined formulaically based on the output of those metrics.\n", "The more clear-cut the rules are, the less arguing there will be about whether someone did something wrong. For example, we have rules about how employees can manage their own investments in a way that doesn\u2019t conflict with how we manage money for clients. Because these rules are clear-cut, there\u2019s no room for argument when a breach occurs.\n", "Having metrics that allow everyone to see everyone else\u2019s track record will make evaluation more objective and fair. People will do the things that will get them higher grades and will argue less about them. Of course, since most people have a number of things to do that are of different importance, different metrics have to be used and weighted appropriately. The more data you collect, the more immediate and precise the feedback will be. That is one of the reasons I created the Dot Collector tool to work as it does (providing lots of immediate feedback); people often use the feedback that they get during a meeting to course-correct in the meeting in real time.\n", "Once you have your metrics, you can tie them to an algorithm that spits out consequences. They can be as simple as saying that for every time you do X you will earn Y amount of money (or bonus points), or it can be more complex (for example, tying the weighted mix of metrics grades to various algorithms that provide the estimated compensation or bonus points).\n", "While this process will never be exact, it will still be good in even its crudest form, and over time it will evolve to be terrific. Even when flawed, the formulaic output can be used with discretion to provide a more precise evaluation and compensation; over time it will evolve into a wonderful machine that will do much of your managing better than you could do it on your own.\n", "b. Encourage people to be objectively reflective about their performance. Being able to see yourself from a higher level is essential for personal evolution and achieving your goals.

If required, use agreed-upon others to triangulate the picture the evidence presents.\n", "c. Look at the whole picture. In reviewing someone, the goal is to see the patterns and to understand the whole picture. No one can be successful in every way (if they are extremely meticulous, for example, they might not be able to be fast, and vice versa). Assessments made in reviews must be concrete; they\u2019re not about what people should be like but what they are like.\n", "d. For performance reviews, start from specific cases, look for patterns, and get in sync with the person being reviewed by looking at the evidence together. While feedback should be constant, reviews are typically periodic; their purpose is to bring together the accumulated evidence of what a person is like as it pertains to their job performance. If the constant feedback is done well, it will become like a constant review as the bits and pieces will add up to the whole. A review should contain few surprises, because you should continuously be striving to make sense of how the person is doing their job. If you think their job is being done badly, you should have been probing to identify and address the root causes of their underperformance on a case-by-case basis. It\u2019s difficult for people to identify their own weaknesses; they need the appropriate probing (not nit-picking) of specific cases by others to get at the truth of what they are like and how they are fitting into their jobs.\n", "In some cases it won\u2019t take long to see what a person is like; in other cases it\u2019s a lot harder. But over time and with a large enough sample of cases, their track records (the level and the steepness up or down in the trajectories that they are responsible for, rather than the occasional wiggles) should paint a clear picture of what you can expect from them. If there are performance issues, it is either because of design problems (perhaps the person has too many responsibilities) or fit/abilities problems. If the problems are due to the person\u2019s inabilities, these inabilities are either because of the person\u2019s innate weaknesses in doing that job (e.g., someone who\u2019s five foot two probably shouldn\u2019t be a center on the basketball team) or because of inadequate training. A good review, and getting in sync throughout the year, should get at these things. Make sure to make your assessment relative to the absolute bar, not just the progress over time. What matters most is not just outcomes but how responsibilities were handled. The goal of a review is to be clear about what the person can and can\u2019t be trusted to do based on what they are like. From there, you can determine what to do about it.\n", "e. Remember that when it comes to assessing people, the two biggest mistakes you can make are being overconfident in your assessment and failing to get in sync on it. If you believe that something is true about someone, it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure that it is true and that the person you\u2019re assessing agrees. Of course, in some cases it may be impossible to get in sync (if you believe that someone was dishonest and they insist that they weren\u2019t, for example), but in a culture of truth and transparency it is an obligation to share your view and let others express theirs.\n", "f. Get in sync on assessments in a nonhierarchical way. In most organizations, evaluations run in only one direction, with the manager assessing the managee. The managee typically disagrees with the assessment, especially if it is worse than his or her self-assessment, because most people believe themselves to be better than they really are. Managees also have opinions about managers that they wouldn\u2019t dare bring up in most companies, so misunderstandings and resentments fester. This perverse behavior undermines the effectiveness of the environment and the relationships between people. It can be avoided by getting in sync in a high-quality way.\n", "Your reports have to believe that you\u2019re not their enemy\u2014that your sole goal is to move toward the truth; that you are trying to help them and so will not enable their self-deception, perpetuate a lie, or let them off the hook. This has to be done in an honest and transparent way, because if someone believes they are being pigeonholed unfairly the process won\u2019t work. As equal partners, it is up to both of you to get to the truth. When each party is an equal participant, no one can feel cornered.\n", "g. Learn about your people and have them learn about you through frank conversations about mistakes and their root causes. You need to be clear in conveying your assessments to your reports and open-minded in listening to their replies so you can work on setting their training and career paths together.

Understand that making sure people are doing a good job doesn\u2019t require watching everything that everybody is doing at all times. You just have to know what they are like and get a sampling. Regular sampling of a statistically reliable number of cases will show you what a person is like and what you can expect from them.

I probe their thinking in a very frank way so as not to let them off the hook. Doing this has taught me a lot about how to assess others\u2019 logic, and how to have better logic myself.

Failing to distinguish between these causes is a common mistake among managers, because managers are often reluctant to appear unkind or judgmental. Also, they know that people assessed this way tend to push back. This is another one of those situations in which you must force yourself to be practical and realistic.\n", "b. Training and testing a poor performer to see if he or she can acquire the required skills without simultaneously trying to assess their abilities is a common mistake.

People who repeatedly operate in a certain way will probably continue to operate that way because that behavior reflects what they\u2019re like. Since people generally change slowly, you should expect slow improvement (at best). Instead, you need to change the people or change the design.

Keeping people in jobs they are not suited for is terrible for them because it allows them to live in a false reality while holding back their personal evolution, and it is terrible for the community because it compromises the meritocracy and everyone pays the price.

I built the machine that is Bridgewater by constantly comparing its actual outcomes to my mental map of the outcomes that it should be producing, and finding ways to improve it. I won\u2019t say anything specific about how you should set your own organization\u2019s goals other than that the high-level principles about goal setting I covered in Life Principles apply equally to individuals and organizations. I will, however, point out that in running your organization, you and the people you work with must be clear on how your lower-level goals\u2014whether they\u2019re to produce things cost-effectively, achieve high customer satisfaction, help a certain number of people in need, whatever\u2014grow out of your higher-level goals and values.No matter how good you are at design, your machine will have problems. You or some other capable mechanic needs to identify those problems and look under the hood of the machine to diagnose their root causes. You or whoever is diagnosing those problems has to understand what the parts of the machine\u2014the designs and the people\u2014are like and how they work together to produce the outcomes. The people are the most important part, since most everything, including the designs themselves, comes from people. Unless you have a clear understanding of your machine from a higher level\u2014and can visualize all its parts and how they work together\u2014you will inevitably fail at this diagnosis and fall short of your potential. At Bridgewater, the high-level goal of all of our machines is to create excellent outcomes for our clients\u2014in the returns on their investments, of course, but also in the quality of our relationship and our thought partnership in understanding global economies and markets more broadly. Before we had anything else at Bridgewater, we had this commitment to excellence. Maintaining these extremely high standards has always been a challenge, especially as the pace of our growth and change accelerated. In the next several chapters, I will walk you through a case in which our client service outcomes began to slip and show how we used the 5-Step Process to improve our machine.But first, I want to share some high-level principles for building and evolving the machine that is any organization.\n"], "Look down on your machine and yourself within it from the higher level. Higher-level thinking isn\u2019t something that\u2019s done by higher-level beings. It\u2019s simply seeing things from the top down.

Then you can get more granular, by zooming into a closer-up view of your country, your city, your neighborhood, and finally your immediate environment.

Constantly compare your outcomes to your goals. You must always be simultaneously trying to accomplish the goal and evaluating the machine (the people and the design), as all outcomes are reflections of how the machine is running. Whenever you identify a problem with your machine, you need to diagnose whether it is the result of a flaw in its design or in the way your people are handling their responsibilities. Sample size is important. Any problem can be a one-off imperfection or a symptom of root causes that will show up as problems repeatedly. If you look at enough problems, which one it is will become clear.\n", "10.1.b. Understand that a great manager is essentially an organizational engineer. Great managers are not philosophers, entertainers, doers, or artists. They are engineers. They see their organizations as machines and work assiduously to maintain and improve them. They create process-flow diagrams to show how the machine works and to evaluate its design. They build metrics to light up how well each of the individual parts of the machine (most importantly, the people) and the machine as a whole are working. And they tinker constantly with its designs and its people to make both better.They don\u2019t do this randomly. They do it systematically, always keeping the cause-and-effect relationships in mind. And while they care deeply about the people involved, they cannot allow their feelings for them or their desire to spare them discomfort to stand in the way of the machine\u2019s constant improvement. To do otherwise wouldn\u2019t be good for either the individuals on the team or the team that the individuals are a part of. Of course, the higher up you are in an organization, the more important vision and creativity become, but you still must have the skills required to manage/orchestrate well. Some young entrepreneurs start with the vision and creativity and then develop their management skills as they scale their companies; others start with management skills and develop vision as they climb the ladder. But like great musicians, all great managers have both creativity and technical skills. And no manager at any level can expect to succeed without the skill set of an organizational engineer.\n", "10.1.c. Build great metrics. Metrics show how the machine is working by providing numbers and setting off alert lights in a dashboard. Metrics are an objective means of assessment and they tend to have a favorable impact on productivity. If your metrics are good enough, you can gain such a complete and accurate view of what your people are doing and how well they are doing it that you can almost manage via the metrics alone. In constructing your metrics, imagine the most important questions you need answered in order to know how things are going and imagine what numbers will give you the answers to them. Don\u2019t look at the numbers that you have and try to adapt them to your purposes, because you won\u2019t get what you need. Instead start with the most important questions and imagine the metrics that will answer them. Remember that any single metric can mislead; you need enough evidence to establish patterns. And of course the information that goes into the metrics must be assessed for accuracy. A reluctance to be critical can be detected by looking at the average grade each grader gives; those giving higher average grades might be easy graders and vice versa. Similarly helpful are \u201cforced rankings,\u201d in which people must rank co-worker performance from best to worst. Forced rankings are essentially the same thing as \u201cgrading on a curve.\u201d Metrics that allow for independent grading across departments and groups are especially valuable.\n", "10.1.d.

When having the machine-level discussion, think clearly how things should have gone and explore why they didn\u2019t go that way.

When making rules, explain the principles behind them.

The way to achieve this is via principles that are sound and that have been tested through open discussion.\n", "10.2.d. Your policies should be natural extensions of your principles. Principles are hierarchical\u2014some are overarching and some are less important\u2014but they all should inform the policies that guide your individual decisions. It pays to think those policies through to ensure that they are consistent with each other and the principles they are derived from. When faced with a case that doesn\u2019t have a clear policy to follow (for example, what to do about an employee whose job is to travel but who faces potential health risks because of his travel), one can\u2019t just snatch an answer out of the blue without regard for higher-level principles. Policymakers must make policy in the same way that the judicial system creates case law\u2014iteratively and incrementally, by dealing with specific cases and interpreting the law as it applies to them. That is how I have tried to operate. When a case arises, I lay out the principles behind how I am handling it and get in sync with others to see if we agree on those principles or must modify them to make them better.

Changes in policies must be approved by those who made them (or someone else who has been made responsible for evolving them). When someone wishes to make an exception to an important policy at Bridgewater, they must write up a proposed alternative policy and escalate their request to the Management Committee.Exceptions should be extremely rare because policies that have frequent exceptions are ineffective.

Like the conductor of an orchestra, they do not play an instrument, but direct their people so that they play beautifully together.

Not managing is having them do their jobs without your oversight and involvement. To be successful, you need to understand these differences and manage at the right level.\n", "10.3.a. Managers must make sure that what they are responsible for works well. They can do this by 1) managing others well (as explained above), 2) job slipping down to do work they\u2019re not responsible for because others can\u2019t do their jobs well, or 3) escalating what they can\u2019t manage well. The first choice is optimal; the second signals that a change is needed in the people and the design; the third choice is harder still but mandatory.\n", "10.3.b. Managing the people who report to you should feel like skiing together. Like a ski instructor, you need to have close contact with your people on the slopes so that you can assess their strengths and weaknesses as they are doing their jobs.

At the same time, there\u2019s danger in thinking you\u2019re delegating details when you\u2019re actually being too distant from what\u2019s important and essentially are not managing.

Learn how much confidence to have in your people\u2014don\u2019t assume it. No manager should delegate responsibilities to people they don\u2019t know well. It takes time to learn about people and how much confidence you can vest in them. Sometimes new people are offended when their managers don\u2019t have confidence in how they are carrying out their responsibilities.

Vary your involvement based on your confidence. Management largely consists of scanning and probing everything you are responsible for to identify suspicious signs. Based on what you see, you should vary your degree of digging, doing more for people and areas that look suspicious, and less where what you see instills confidence.

If it doesn\u2019t, you run the risk of not managing. The tools I have developed give me windows into what people are doing and what they are like, and I follow up on problems.\n", "10.6.c. Use daily updates as a tool for staying on top of what your people are doing and thinking. I ask each person who reports to me to take about ten to fifteen minutes to write a brief description of what they did that day, the issues pertaining to them, and their reflections. By reading these updates and triangulating them (i.e., seeing other people\u2019s takes on what they are doing together), I can gauge how they are working together, what their moods are, and which threads I should pull on.\n", "10.6.d. Probe so you know whether problems are likely to occur before they actually do. If problems take you by surprise, it is probably because you are either too far removed from your people and processes or you haven\u2019t adequately visualized how the people and processes might lead to various outcomes. When a crisis is brewing, contact should be close enough that there will be no surprises.\n", "10.6.e. Probe to the level below the people who report to you. You can\u2019t understand how the person who reports to you manages others unless you know their direct reports and can observe how they behave.\n", "10.6.f. Have the people who report to the people who report to you feel free to escalate their problems to you. This is a great and useful form of upward accountability.\n", "10.6.g. Don\u2019t assume that people\u2019s answers are correct. People\u2019s answers could be erroneous theories or spin, so you need to occasionally double-check them, especially when they sound questionable. Some managers are reluctant to do this, feeling it is the equivalent of saying they don\u2019t trust their people. These managers need to understand that this process is how trust is earned or lost. Your people will learn to be much more accurate in what they tell you if they understand this\u2014and you will learn who you can rely on.\n", "10.6.h. Train your ear. Over time, you\u2019ll hear the same verbal cues indicating that someone is thinking about something badly or failing to apply principles appropriately. For example, listen for the anonymous \u201cwe\u201d as a cue that someone is likely depersonalizing a mistake.\n", "10.6.i. Make your probing transparent rather than private. This helps assure the quality of the probing (because others can make their own assessments), and it will reinforce the culture of truth and transparency.\n", "10.6.j. Welcome probing. It\u2019s important to welcome probing of yourself because no one can see themselves objectively. When you are being probed, it\u2019s essential to stay calm. Your emotional \u201clower-level you\u201d will probably react to probing with something like, \u201cYou\u2019re a jerk because you\u2019re against me and making me feel bad,\u201d whereas your thoughtful \u201chigher-level you\u201d should be thinking, \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that we can be completely honest like this and have such a thoughtful exchange to help assure that I\u2019m doing things well.\u201d Listen to your higher-level you and don\u2019t lose sight of how difficult it can be for the person doing the probing. Besides helping to make the organization and your relationship with the person who is probing you go well, working yourself through this difficult probing will build your character and your equanimity.\n", "10.6.k. Remember that people who see things and think one way often have difficulty communicating with and relating to people who see things and think another way. Imagine you had to describe what a rose smells like to someone who lacks a sense of smell. No matter how accurate your explanation, it will always fall short of the actual experience. The same thing is true of differences in ways of thinking. They are like blind spots, and if you have one (which we all do), it can be challenging to see what\u2019s there. Working through these differences requires a lot of patience and open-mindedness, as well as triangulating with other people who can help fill in the picture.\n", "10.6.l. Pull all suspicious threads. It\u2019s worth pulling all suspicious threads because: 1) Small negative situations can be symptomatic of serious underlying problems; 2) Resolving small differences of perception may prevent more serious divergence of views; and 3) In trying to create a culture that values excellence, constantly reinforcing the need to point out and stare at problems\u2014no matter how small\u2014is essential (otherwise you risk setting an example of tolerating mediocrity). Prioritization can be a trap if it causes you to ignore the problems around you. Allowing small problems to go unnoticed and unaddressed creates the perception that it\u2019s acceptable to tolerate such things. Imagine that all your little problems are small pieces of trash you\u2019re stepping over to get to the other side of a room. Sure, what\u2019s on the other side of the room may be very important, but it won\u2019t hurt you to pick up the trash as you come to it, and by reinforcing the culture of excellence it will have positive second- and third-order consequences that will reverberate across your whole organization. While you don\u2019t need to pick up every piece, you should never lose sight of the fact that you\u2019re stepping over the trash nor that it\u2019s probably not as hard as you think to pick up a piece or two as you go on your way.\n", "10.6.m. Recognize that there are many ways to skin a cat. Your assessment of how Responsible Parties are doing their jobs should not be based on whether they\u2019re doing it your way but whether they\u2019re doing it in a good way.

If you are an employee, and you get a paycheck for turning up and pleasing your boss, your mind-set will inevitably be trained to this cause-effect relationship. If you are a manager, make sure you structure incentives and penalties that encourage people to take full ownership of what they do and not just coast by. This includes straightforward things such as spending money like it\u2019s their own and making sure their responsibilities aren\u2019t neglected when they\u2019re out of the office. When people recognize that their own well-being is directly connected to that of their community, the ownership relationship becomes reciprocal.\n", "10.7.a. Going on vacation doesn\u2019t mean one can neglect one\u2019s responsibilities. Thinking like an owner means making sure that your responsibilities are handled well regardless of what comes up. While you are away on vacation, it\u2019s your responsibility to make sure nothing drops. You can do that via a combination of good planning and coordination before you go and staying on top of things while you are away. This needn\u2019t take much time\u2014it can be as little as an hour of good checking from afar and it doesn\u2019t even have to be every day, so you can typically slip it in when it\u2019s convenient.\n", "10.7.b.

That\u2019s why I\u2019ve tried to flesh out Bridgewater\u2019s principles in enough depth that differences are accounted for. For example, if someone has worked at Bridgewater for many years, that factors into how they are treated. Likewise, while I find all dishonesty intolerable, I don\u2019t treat all acts of dishonesty and all people who are dishonest the same.\n", "10.9.a. Don\u2019t let yourself get squeezed.

While some people have advised me that it\u2019s easier to just make such things go away, I\u2019ve found doing that is almost always shortsighted. Giving in not only compromises your values, it telegraphs that the rules of the game have changed and opens you up to more of the same.

Most people think a good leader is a strong person who engenders confidence in others and motivates them to follow him/her, with the emphasis on \u201cfollow.\u201d The stereotypical leader often sees questioning and disagreement as threatening and prefers people do what they\u2019re told. As an extension of this paradigm, the leader bears the main burden of decision making. But because such leaders are never as all-knowing as they try to appear, disenchantment and even anger tends to set in. That\u2019s why people who once loved their charismatic leaders often want to get rid of them.This traditional relationship between \u201cleaders\u201d and \u201cfollowers\u201d is the opposite of what I believe is needed to be most effective, and being maximally effective is the most important thing a \u201cleader\u201d must do. It is more practical to be honest about one\u2019s uncertainties, mistakes, and weaknesses than to pretend they don\u2019t exist. It is also more important to have good challengers than good followers. Thoughtful discussion and disagreement is practical because it stress-tests leaders and brings what they are missing to their attention.One thing that leaders should not do, in my opinion, is be manipulative. Sometimes leaders will use emotions to motivate people to do things that they would not do after reflecting clearly. When dealing with intelligent people in an idea meritocracy, it is essential that one always appeal to their reason rather than their base emotions.The most effective leaders work to 1) open-mindedly seek out the best answers and 2) bring others along as part of that discovery process. That is how learning and getting in sync occurs. A truly great leader is appropriately uncertain but well equipped to deal with that uncertainty through open-minded exploration. All else being equal, I think the kind of leader who looks and acts like a skilled ninja will beat the kind of leader who looks and acts like a muscular action hero every time.\n", "10.10.a. Be weak and strong at the same time. Sometimes asking questions to gain perspective can be misperceived as being weak and indecisive. Of course it\u2019s not. It\u2019s necessary in order to become wise and it is a prerequisite for being strong and decisive. Always seek the advice of wise others and let those who are better than you take the lead. The objective is to have the best understanding to make the best possible leadership decisions. Be open-minded and assertive at the same time and get in tight sync with those who work with you, recognizing that sometimes not all or even the majority of people will agree with you.\n", "10.10.b.

Just worry about making the best decisions possible, recognizing that no matter what you do, most everyone will think you\u2019re doing something\u2014or many things\u2014wrong. It is human nature for people to want you to believe their own opinions and to get angry at you if you don\u2019t, even when they have no reason to believe that their opinions are good. So, if you\u2019re leading well, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if people disagree with you. The important thing is for you to be logical and objective in assessing your probabilities of being right. It is not illogical or arrogant to believe that you know better than the average person, so long as you are appropriately open-minded. In fact, it is not logical to believe that what the average person thinks is better than what you and the most insightful people around you think, because you have earned your way into your higher-than-average position and you and those insightful people are more informed than the average person. If the opposite were true, then you and the average man shouldn\u2019t have your respective jobs. In other words, if you don\u2019t have better insights than them, you shouldn\u2019t be a leader\u2014and if you do have better insights than them, don\u2019t worry if you are doing unpopular things. So how should you deal with your people? Your choices are either to ignore them (which will lead to resentment and your ignorance of what they are thinking), blindly do what they want (which wouldn\u2019t be a good idea), or encourage them to bring their disagreements to the surface and work through them so openly and reasonably that everyone will recognize the relative merits of your thinking. Have the open disagreement and be happy to either win or lose the thought battles, as long as the best ideas win out.

When you are the only one thinking, the results will suffer. Authoritarian managers don\u2019t develop their subordinates, which means those who report to them stay dependent.

Avoid getting sucked down. This occurs when a manager is pulled down to doing the tasks of a subordinate without acknowledging the problem. The sucked-down phenomenon bears some resemblance to job slip, since it involves the manager\u2019s responsibilities slipping into areas that should be left to others. But while job slipping can make sense on a temporary basis to push through to a goal, it\u2019s also generally a signal that a part of the machine is broken and needs fixing. The sucked-down phenomenon is what happens when a manager chronically fails to properly redesign an area of responsibility to keep him or herself from having to do the job that others should be capable of doing well. You can tell this problem exists when the manager focuses more on getting tasks done than on operating his or her machine.\n", "10.11.d. Watch out for people who confuse goals and tasks, because if they can\u2019t make that distinction, you can\u2019t trust them with responsibilities.

One way to test this: If you ask a high-level question like \u201cHow is goal XYZ going?\u201d a good answer will provide a synthesis up-front of how XYZ is going overall and, if needed, will support it by accounting for the tasks that were done to achieve it.

To be successful you must perceive and not tolerate them. Problems are like coal thrown into a locomotive engine because burning them up\u2014inventing and implementing solutions for them\u2014propels us forward. Every problem you find is an opportunity to improve your machine. Identifying and not tolerating problems is one of the most important and disliked things people can do. For a lot of people identifying problems is difficult to do. Most people would rather celebrate all the things that are going well while sweeping problems under the rug. Those people have their priorities exactly backward, and there is little that can be more harmful to an organization. Don\u2019t undermine your progress in pursuit of a pat on the back; celebrate finding out what is not going well so you can make it go better. Thinking about problems that are difficult to solve may make you anxious, but not thinking about them (and therefore not dealing with them) should make you even more anxious. Having this kind of anxiety about what can go wrong is extremely useful. It is what drives one to develop systems and metrics for monitoring the outcomes your machine is producing and motivates those who manage well to constantly taste-test the outputs of the system and to look for problems in its nooks and crannies. Having that constant worry and doing the double-checking is important to maintaining quality control. Making sure that little problems don\u2019t exist is important because, if they\u2019re allowed to continue, they will grow into big problems. To convey the point, I will tell you about a case in which we initially failed to maintain excellence, then perceived the problem, got at its root causes, designed changes, and pushed those changes through to produce excellent results. When I started Bridgewater, I was responsible for everything. I made the company\u2019s investment decisions and its management decisions and then I built the organization to support me and eventually to carry on excellently without me. As Bridgewater grew, the standard I set was uncompromising and straightforward: The analysis we provide to clients should always be of the same quality it would be if I did it myself. That\u2019s because when clients ask what \u201cwe\u201d think, they aren\u2019t asking what just anyone thinks\u2014they want to know what I and the other CIOs, who are in charge of our investments, are thinking. To achieve that goal, Bridgewater\u2019s Client Service Department either handles the questions they get from clients themselves or passes them on to people with various levels of expertise who are assigned to answer questions based on their level of difficulty. The client advisor (who is a knowledgeable professional designed to be the interface between Bridgewater and the client) has to understand the questions well enough to know who they should be routed to, and they need to review the answers before they go back to the client to ensure they are excellent. To be certain that always happens, I created a checks-and-balances system in which some of our best investment thinkers both draft memos to clients themselves and quality-control their colleagues\u2019 work, grading it to provide traceable metrics that can be followed to monitor how well things are going and make changes as needed. In 2011, as a part of my management transition, I handed the oversight of this process to others, and several months later one of the people in the Client Service Department began noticing problems. It started with one memo, which two senior investment advisors noticed had gone out the door to a client even though it contained errors. Though these were minor errors, they were important errors to me. With my prodding, the new management team began investigating other memos and discovered that this poorly prepared memo wasn\u2019t just a one-off; it was symptomatic of a more widespread breakdown in the quality control machine. Worse still, the investigation revealed the Responsible Parties were failing to perceive and diagnose these problems. And most worrisome, it wasn\u2019t clear that, without my pushing, anyone else would have taken the time to investigate. This initial failure to perceive and not tolerate problems did not happen for lack of caring; it happened because most of the people in the process paid more attention to getting the tasks done than assessing whether the goals were being achieved. They had become more like rubber stampers than craftsmen, while the top people who were supposed to \u201ctaste the soup\u201d to make sure it was excellent were focused on other things. Discovering this was disappointing to all of us, because it showed that the high standards that for so long had been the reasons for our success were slipping. Facing this reality was painful, but ultimately healthy. The existence of a problem like this one\u2014whether from a flaw in the design of one\u2019s machine or from one\u2019s own or others\u2019 inabilities\u2014is not shameful. Acknowledging a weakness isn\u2019t the same thing as accepting it. It\u2019s a necessary first step toward overcoming it. The pain one feels, whether from shame and embarrassment, or frustration at one\u2019s inability to get the better of it, is like the pain one feels at getting flabby that motivates one to go to the gym.

If you see something that seems unacceptable to you, don\u2019t assume that the fact that others also know about it and aren\u2019t screaming means it\u2019s not a problem.

What are the most common reasons for failing to diagnose well? The most common mistake I see people make is dealing with their problems as one-offs rather than using them to diagnose how their machine is working so that they can improve it. They move on to fix problems without getting at their root causes, which is a recipe for continued failure. A thorough and accurate diagnosis, while more time-consuming, will pay huge dividends in the future. The second most common mistake people make is to depersonalize the diagnosis. Not connecting problems to the people who failed and not examining what it is about them that caused the failure will not lead to improvements of the individuals or the machines. The third biggest reason for failure is to not connect what one is learning in one diagnosis to what was learned in prior ones. It is important to determine whether the root cause of a particular problem (\u201cHarry was careless\u201d) is part of a larger pattern (\u201cHarry is often careless\u201d) or not (\u201cIt\u2019s unlike Harry to be careless\u201d). In the case of our client service analytics team, I knew that unless we got to the root cause of the problems, standards would continue to decline. Bridgewater\u2019s other leaders agreed. So I led a series of diagnostic sessions with the team, getting everyone at every level into the room to probe and find out what had gone wrong. I started with my mental map of how things should\u2019ve gone\u2014based on the machine I\u2019d built\u2014and asked the new managers to describe what had actually happened. Bad outcomes don\u2019t just happen; they occur because specific people make, or fail to make, specific decisions. A good diagnosis always gets to the level of determining what it is about those people that led to the bad outcomes. This can be uncomfortable but if someone isn\u2019t suited for a job, they need to be moved out of it so that the same mistakes won\u2019t keep occurring. Of course, nobody is perfect; everyone makes mistakes. So it is important to look at people\u2019s track records and their specific strengths and weaknesses in doing a diagnosis. Coming out of these sessions, a few things were clear: Several of the new line managers who the top managers had brought in to run client service analytics didn\u2019t have the right skills, synthesis abilities, or levels of caring to oversee the quality-control process; and the top managers were far too distant from the area and not probing adequately to make sure that everything was going well. This was the \u201cwhat is\u201d\u2014the reality we faced that produced our problems. It wasn\u2019t a pretty picture, but it was exactly what we needed to know in order to move to the next step of designing the changes we had to make. The following principles flesh out how to diagnose well, beginning with a basic overview.\n"], "To diagnose well, ask the following questions: 1. Is the outcome good or bad? 2. Who is responsible for the outcome? 3. If the outcome is bad, is the Responsible Party incapable and/or is the design bad?": ["To diagnose well, ask the following questions: 1. Is the outcome good or bad? 2. Who is responsible for the outcome? 3. If the outcome is bad, is the Responsible Party incapable and/or is the design bad?\n", "If you keep those big questions in mind and anchor back to them, you should do well. What follows is a guide for getting the answers to these big-picture questions, mostly using a series of simple either/or questions to help you get to the synthesis you are looking for at each step. You should think of these as the answers you need before moving to the next step, leading all the way to the final diagnosis. You can, but don\u2019t need to, follow these questions or this format exactly. Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to move through these questions quickly or you may need to ask some different, more granular questions. Is the outcome good or bad? And who is responsible for the outcome? If you can\u2019t quickly get in sync that the outcome was bad and who specifically was responsible, you\u2019re probably already headed for the weeds (in other words, into a discussion of tiny, irrelevant details). If the outcome is bad, is the RP incapable and/or is the design bad? The goal is to come to this synthesis, though to get there you may need to examine how the machine worked in this instance and build the synthesis from there. How should the machine have worked? You may have a mental map of who should have done what, or you may need to fill it in using other people\u2019s mental maps. In any case, you need to learn who was responsible for doing what and what the principles say about how things should\u2019ve gone. Keep it simple! At this stage, a common pitfall is to delve into a granular examination of procedural details rather than stay at the level of the machine (the level of who was responsible for doing what). You should be able to crystallize your mental map in just a few statements, each connected to a specific person. If you are delving into details here, you are probably off track. Once you\u2019ve established the mental map the key question is: Did the machine work as it should have? Yes or no. If not, what didn\u2019t go as it should have? What broke? This is called the proximate cause and this step should be easy to get to if you laid out the mental map clearly. You can do this via yes/no questions as well because it should just require referring back to the key components of your mental map and pinpointing which the RP or RPs didn\u2019t do well. Say your mental map of how the machine should have worked has two steps: that Harry should have either 1) done his assignment on time or 2) escalated that he couldn\u2019t. All you have to do is pinpoint the two steps. 1) Did he do it on time? Yes or no. And if not, 2) did he escalate? Yes or no. It should be this simple. But this is when the conversation often gets dragged into gobbledygook, where someone goes into a detailed explanation of \u201cwhat they did.\u201d Remember: It\u2019s your job to guide the conversation toward an accurate and clear synthesis. You also have to synthesize whether the problem was meaningful\u2014that is, whether a capable person would have made the same mistake given the circumstances, or whether it\u2019s symptomatic of something worth digging into. Don\u2019t focus too much on rare events or the trivial problems\u2014nothing and no one is perfect\u2014but be sure you are not overlooking a clue to a systemic machine problem. It\u2019s your job to make that determination. Why didn\u2019t things go as they should have? This is where you have synthesized the root cause in order to determine whether the RP is capable or not\u2014or whether the issue is with the design. In order to anchor back to a synthesis rather than get lost in the details you might: Try to tie the failure to the 5-Step Process. Which step was not done well? Everything ultimately fits into those five steps. But you may need to get more specific, so: Try to crystallize the failure as a specific key attribute or set of attributes. Ask yes/no questions: Did the RP not manage well? Not perceive problems well? Not execute well? Importantly, ask yourself this question: If X attribute is done well next time, will the bad outcome still occur? This is a good way of making sure you are logically connecting the outcome back to the case. Think of it this way: If your mechanic replaced that part in your car, would that fix it? If the root cause is a faulty design, don\u2019t stop there. Ask who was responsible for the faulty design and whether they are capable of designing well. Is the root cause a pattern? (Yes or no.) Any problem can be a one-off imperfection\u2014or it could be a symptom of a root cause that will show up repeatedly. You need to determine which it is. In other words, if Harry failed to do the assignment due to reliability: Does Harry have a reliability problem in general? If so, is reliability required for the role? Is Harry\u2019s failure due to training or abilities? How should the people/machines evolve as a result? Confirm that the short-term resolution of the issue has been addressed, as needed. Determine the steps to be taken for long-term solutions and who is responsible for those steps. Specifically: Are there responsibilities that need to be assigned or clarified? Are there machine designs that need to be reworked? Are there people whose fit for their roles needs to be reevaluated? For example, if you\u2019ve determined that 1) it\u2019s a pattern, 2) the RP is missing an attribute that\u2019s required for the role, and 3) the attribute is missing due to the RP\u2019s ability (not their training)\u2014then you\u2019ve likely been able to determine the answer to your most important question: the person is not capable and needs to be sorted from the role. The following principles further flesh out how to diagnose well.\n", "12.1.a. Ask yourself: \u201cWho should do what differently?\u201d I often hear people complaining about a particular outcome without attempting to understand the machine that caused it. In many cases, these complaints come from people who are seeing the cons of some decision but not the pros and don\u2019t know how the Responsible Party weighed them to come to a decision. Since all outcomes ultimately come from people and designs, asking yourself \u201cWho should do what differently?\u201d will point you in the direction of the kind of understanding that you need to actually change outcomes in the future (versus just chirping about them).\n", "12.1.b. Identify at which step in the 5-Step Process the failure occurred. If a person is chronically failing, it is due to a lack of training or a lack of ability. Which is it? At which of the five steps did the person fail? Different steps require different abilities and if you can identify which abilities are lacking, you\u2019ll go a long way toward diagnosing the problem.\n", "12.1.c. Identify the principles that were violated. Identify which principles apply to the case at hand, review them, and see if they would have helped. Think for yourself which principles are best for handling similar cases. This will help solve not only this problem but other problems like it.\n", "12.1.d. Avoid Monday morning quarterbacking. Evaluate the merits of a past decision based not on what you know now but only on what you could have reasonably known at the time the decision was made. Every decision has pros and cons; you can\u2019t evaluate choices in retrospect without the appropriate context. Do this by asking yourself, \u201cWhat should a quality person have known and done in that situation?\u201d Also, have a deep understanding of the person who made the decision (how they think, the type of person they are, whether they learned from the situation, and so on).\n", "12.1.e. Don\u2019t confuse the quality of someone\u2019s circumstances with the quality of their approach to dealing with the circumstances. One can be good and the other can be bad, and it\u2019s easy to confuse which is which. Such confusion is especially common in organizations that are doing new things and evolving fast but haven\u2019t yet gotten the kinks out. I have always described Bridgewater as being \u201cterrible and terrific at the same time.\u201d For nearly forty years, we have consistently produced extraordinary results while struggling with lots of problems. It is easy to look at messy circumstances, think things must be terrible, and get frustrated. But the real challenge is to look at the long-term successes these messy circumstances have produced and understand how essential they are to the evolutionary process of innovation.\n", "12.1.f. Identifying the fact that someone else doesn\u2019t know what to do doesn\u2019t mean that you know what to do. It\u2019s one thing to point out a problem; it\u2019s another to have an accurate diagnosis and a quality solution. As described earlier, the litmus test for a good problem solver is 1) they are able to logically describe how to handle the problem and 2) they have successfully solved similar problems in the past.\n", "12.1.g. Remember that a root cause is not an action but a reason. Root causes are described in adjectives, not verbs, so keep asking \u201cwhy\u201d to get at them. Since most things are done or not done because someone decided to do them or not do them in a certain way, most root causes can be traced to specific people who have specific patterns of behavior. Of course, a normally reliable person can make the occasional error and if that\u2019s the case, then it can be forgiven, but when a problem is attributable to a person, you have to ask why they made the mistake\u2014and you have to be as accurate in diagnosing a fault in a person as you would be if he or she were a piece of equipment. A root cause discovery process might proceed like this: The problem was due to bad programming. Why was there bad programming? Because Harry programmed it badly. Why did Harry program it badly? Because he wasn\u2019t well trained and because he was in a rush. Why wasn\u2019t he well trained? Did his manager know that he wasn\u2019t well trained and let him do the job anyway, or did he not know? Consider how personal the questioning is. It doesn\u2019t stop at \u201cBecause Harry programmed it badly.\u201d You must go deeper in order to understand what about the people and/or the design led to the failure. This is difficult for both the diagnoser and the RPs, and it often results in people bringing up all kinds of irrelevant details. Be on your guard because people will often look to cover themselves by diving into the weeds.\n", "12.1.h. To distinguish between a capacity issue and a capability issue, imagine how the person would perform at that particular function if they had ample capacity. Think back on how the person performed in similar functions when they had ample capacity. If the same kinds of problems came up, then the problem is very likely one of capabilities.\n", "12.1.i. Keep in mind that managers usually fail or fall short of their goals for one (or more) of five reasons. 1. They are too distant. 2. They have problems perceiving bad quality. 3.

Drill-downs are not diagnoses, but a form of broad and deep probing. They\u2019re not intended to uncover the causes of every problem: only the 20 or so percent of causes that produce 80 percent of the suboptimal effects. A drill-down takes place in two steps and is then followed by design and execution steps. If done well, the two drill-down steps can be done in about four hours. It is very important that the steps be done separately and independently, so as not to go in too many directions at once. Let me take you through the drill-down process, offering guidance and examples for each step. Step 1: List the Problems. Quickly inventory all the core problems. Be very specific, as this is the only way to effectively find solutions. Don\u2019t generalize or use the plural \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cthey.\u201d Name the names of the people experiencing the problems. Have all the relevant people from the area under scrutiny participate in the drill-down; you will benefit from their insights and it will drive their ownership of the solution. Don\u2019t focus on rare events or the trivial problems\u2014nothing is perfect\u2014but be sure they are not symptoms of systematic machine problems. Don\u2019t try to find solutions yet. Your focus in this step is strictly on listing the problems. Step 2: Identify the Root Causes. For each problem, identify the deep-seated reason behind the actions that caused each problem. Most problems happen for one of two reasons: 1. It isn\u2019t clear who the Responsible Party is, or 2. The Responsible Party isn\u2019t handling his/her responsibilities well. You must distinguish proximate causes from root causes. Proximate causes are the reasons or actions that led to the problem. When you start describing the qualities behind these reasons or actions, you are getting closer to the root cause. To get at the root cause, keep asking \u201cWhy?\u201d For example: Problem: The team is continually working late and is on the verge of burning out. Why? Because we don\u2019t have enough capacity to meet the demand put on the team. Why? Because we inherited this new responsibility without additional staff. Why? Because the manager did not understand the volume of work before accepting the responsibility. Why? Because the manager is bad at anticipating problems and creating plans. [Root Cause] Do not exclude any relevant people from the drill-down: Besides losing the benefit of their ideas, you\u2019ll disenfranchise them from the game plan and reduce their sense of ownership. At the same time, remember that people tend to be more defensive than self-critical. It is your job as a manager to get at truth and excellence, not to make people happy. For example, the correct path might be to fire some people and replace them with better people, or put them in jobs they might not want. Everyone\u2019s objective must be to get at the best answers, not the answers that will make the most people happy. You may find that multiple problems identified in Step 1 share the same root cause. Because you are doing a drill-down in a quick session, your root cause diagnoses may only be provisional\u2014essentially alerts about things to watch out for. When Step 2 is completed, take a break to reflect; then come up with a plan. Step 3: Create a Plan. Step away from the group and develop a plan that addresses the root causes. Plans are like movie scripts, where you visualize who will do what through time to achieve the goals. They are developed by iterating through multiple possibilities, weighing the likelihood of goal achievement versus costs and risks. They should have specific tasks, outcomes, Responsible Parties, tracking metrics, and timelines. Allow the key people involved to discuss the plan thoroughly. Not everyone needs to agree on the plan but the Responsible Parties and other key people must be in sync. Step 4: Execute the Plan. Execute the agreed-upon plan and transparently track its progress. At least monthly, report on the planned and actual progress to date and the expectations for the coming period, and hold people publicly accountable for delivering their outcomes successfully and on time. Make adjustments to the plan as required to reflect reality.\n"], "Understand that diagnosis is foundational to both progress and quality relationships.": ["Understand that diagnosis is foundational to both progress and quality relationships.\n", "If you and others are open-minded and engage in a quality back-and-forth, not only will you find better solutions, you will also get to know each other better.

Designs need to be based on deep and accurate understandings (which is why diagnosis is so important); for me, it\u2019s an almost visceral process of staring at problems and using the pain they cause me to stimulate my creative thinking. This is exactly how it was for the team responsible for client service analytics\u2014and especially for Bridgewater\u2019s co-CEO David McCormick, who was then head of the Client Service Department. Coming out of the diagnosis, he moved quickly to design and implement changes. He fired the team members who had allowed standards to slip and reflected deeply on what new designs he could implement to get the right people into the right roles. In selecting his new Responsible Parties for client service analytics, he picked one of our top investment thinkers who also had extremely high standards (and was very outspoken about cases where he saw them slipping) and paired him with one of our most experienced managers, who knew how to build the right process flows and make sure everything that needed to happen would go precisely as planned. But that wasn\u2019t all. When coming up with a design, it\u2019s impor-tant to take time to reflect and make sure you\u2019re looking at the problems from the highest level. David knew it would be a mistake to look only at this one part of the department, because the same slip in quality that had happened there was likely to have occurred in other places too. He needed to think creatively to come up with a design that would build a durable culture of pervasive excellence throughout the entire department. This led to his invention of \u201cQuality Day,\u201d biannual meetings in which members of the Client Service Department would review each other\u2019s mock presentations and memos and give direct feedback on what was good and what wasn\u2019t. More importantly, the meetings were a chance to step back and assess whether the ways of ensuring quality were working as expected\u2014by bringing in a bunch of tough, independent thinkers to offer criticism and get the process realigned on what good looks like. Of course, there were many more details to all of David\u2019s plans for transforming the department. But the important thing is how all the details and plans extended from a high-level visualization of what was required. Only when you have such a sketch can you begin to fill it in with specifics. Those specifics will be your tasks; write them down so you don\u2019t forget them. While the best designs are drawn from a rich understanding of actual problems, when you\u2019re just starting out on something, you often have to design based on anticipated problems as opposed to actual ones. That\u2019s why having systematic ways of tracking issues (the Issue Log) and what people are like (the Dot Collector) is so useful: Instead of just relying on your best guesses of what might go wrong, you can look at data from prior \u201cat bats\u201d for yourself and others and come to the design process with understanding rather than having to start from scratch. The most talented designers I know are people who can visualize over time, running through different collections of people from the scale of small teams to entire organizations, accurately anticipating the kinds of results they\u2019ll produce. They excel at design and systemization. Hence the overriding principle of this chapter: Design and systemize your machine. Creativity is also important to this process, as is character, because the most important problems to design around are often the hardest, and you need to come up with original ways of addressing them and be willing to make hard choices (especially when it comes to people and who should do what). The following principles delve into designing and how to do it well.\n"], "Build your machine. Focus on each task or case at hand and you will be stuck dealing with them one by one. Instead, build a machine by observing what you\u2019re doing and why, extrapolating the relevant principles from the cases at hand, and systemizing that process.

I believe that systemized, evidence-based decision making will radically improve the quality of management. Human managers process information spontaneously using poorly thought-out criteria and are unproductively affected by their emotional biases. These all lead to suboptimal decisions. Imagine what it would be like to have a machine that processes high-quality data using high-quality decision-making principles/criteria.

For example, if you asked me if I\u2019d like to not have rainy days, I probably would say yes if I didn\u2019t consider the second- and third-order consequences.\n", "13.3.d. Use standing meetings to help your organization run like a Swiss clock. Regularly scheduled meetings add to overall efficiency by ensuring that important interactions and to-do\u2019s aren\u2019t overlooked, eliminating the need for inefficient coordination, and improving operations (because repetition leads to refinement). It pays to have standardized meeting agendas that ask the same feedback questions in each meeting (such as how effective the meeting was) and nonstandard meeting agendas that include things done infrequently (such as quarterly budget reviews).\n", "13.3.e.

Even with a good future design picture in mind, it will naturally take some mistakes and learning to get to a good \u201cthen\u201d state. People frequently complain about this kind of iterative process because it tends to be true that people are happier with nothing at all than with something imperfect, even though it would be more logical to have the imperfect thing. That kind of thinking doesn\u2019t make sense, so don\u2019t let it distract you.\n", "13.4.a.

Forests need these storms to be healthy\u2014without them, there would be more weak trees and a buildup of overgrowth that stifles other growth. The same is true for companies. Bad times that force cutbacks so only the strongest and most essential employees (or companies) survive are inevitable and can be great, even though they seem terrible at the time.\n"], "Build the organization around goals rather than tasks.": ["Build the organization around goals rather than tasks.\n", "Giving each department a clear focus and the appropriate resources to achieve its goals makes the diagnosis of resource allocations more straightforward and reduces job slip. As an example of how this works, at Bridgewater we have a Marketing Department (goal: to market) that is separate from our Client Service Department (goal: to service clients), even though they do similar things and there would be advantages to having them work together. But marketing and servicing clients are two distinct goals; if they were merged, the department head, salespeople, client advisors, analysts, and others would be giving and receiving conflicting feedback. If asked why clients were receiving relatively poor attention, the answer might be: \u201cWe have incentives to raise sales.\u201d If asked why they weren\u2019t making sales, the merged department might explain that they need to take care of their clients.\n", "13.5.a. Build your organization from the top down. An organization is the opposite of a building: Its foundation is at the top, so make sure you hire managers before you hire their reports. Managers can help design the machine and choose the people who complement it. People overseeing departments need to be able to think strategically as well as run the day-to-day. If they don\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s coming up, they\u2019ll run the day-to-day off a cliff.\n", "13.5.b. Remember that everyone must be overseen by a believable person who has high standards. Without strong oversight, there is potential for inadequate quality control, inadequate training, and inadequate appreciation of excellent work. Never just trust people to do their jobs well.\n", "13.5.c. Make sure the people at the top of each pyramid have the skills and focus to manage their direct reports and a deep understanding of their jobs. A few years ago, someone at Bridgewater proposed that our facilities group (the people who take care of the building and grounds, food service, office supplies, etc.) should begin to report to our head of technology because of the overlap in the two areas (computers are a facility too, they use electricity, and so on). But having the people who are responsible for janitorial services and meals report to a technology manager would be as inappropriate as having technology people report to the person taking care of facilities. These functions, even if they\u2019re considered \u201cfacilities\u201d in the broadest sense, are very different, as are the respective skill sets. Similarly, at another time, we talked about putting the folks who work on client agreements under the same manager as those who do counterparty agreements. But that would have been a mistake because the skills required to reach agreements with clients are very different from the skills required to reach agreements with counterparties. It would be wrong to conflate both departments under the general heading of \u201cagreements,\u201d because each calls for specific knowledge and skills.\n", "13.5.d. In designing your organization, remember that the 5-Step Process is the path to success and that different people are good at different steps. Assign specific people to do each of these steps based on their natural inclinations. For example, the big-picture visionary should be responsible for goal setting, the taste tester should be assigned the job of identifying and not tolerating problems, the logical detective who doesn\u2019t mind probing people should be the diagnoser, the imaginative designer should craft the plan to make the improvements, and the reliable taskmaster should make sure the plan gets executed. Of course, some people can do more than one of these things\u2014generally people do two or three well. Virtually nobody can do them all well. A team should consist of people with all of these abilities and they should know who is responsible for which steps.\n", "13.5.e. Don\u2019t build the organization to fit the people. Managers will often take the people who work in their organization as a given and try to make the organization work well with them. That\u2019s backward. Instead, they should imagine the best organization and then make sure the right people are chosen for it. Jobs should be created based on the work that needs to be done, not what people want to do or which people are available. You can always search outside to find the people who click best for a particular role. First come up with the best workflow design, then sketch it out on an organizational chart, visualize how the parts interact, and specify what qualities are required for each job. Only after all that is done should you choose the people to fill the slots.\n", "13.5.f. Keep scale in mind. Your goals must be the right size to warrant the resources that you allocate to them. An organization might not be big enough to justify having both a sales and an analytics group, for example. Bridgewater successfully evolved from a one-cell organization, in which most people were involved in everything, to a multi-cellular organization because we retained our ability to focus efficiently as we grew. Temporarily sharing or rotating resources is fine and is not the same as a merging of responsibilities. On the other hand, the efficiency of an organization decreases as the number of people and/or its complexity increases, so keep things as simple as possible. And the larger the organization, the more important are information technology management and cross-departmental communication.\n", "13.5.g. Organize departments and sub-departments around the most logical groupings based on \u201cgravitational pull.\u201d Some groups naturally gravitate toward one another. That gravitational pull might be based on common goals, shared abilities and skills, workflow, physical location, and so forth. Imposing your own structure without acknowledging these magnetic pulls will likely result in inefficiency.\n", "13.5.h. Make departments as self-sufficient as possible so that they have control over the resources they need to achieve their goals. We do this because we don\u2019t want to create a bureaucracy that forces departments to requisition resources from a pool that lacks the focus to do the job.\n", "13.5.i. Ensure that the ratios of senior managers to junior managers and of junior managers to their reports are limited to preserve quality communication and mutual understanding. Generally, the ratio should not be more than 1:10, and preferably closer to 1:5. Of course, the appropriate ratio will vary depending on how many people your direct reports have reporting to them, the complexity of the jobs they\u2019re doing, and a manager\u2019s ability to handle several people or projects at once. The number of layers from top to bottom and the ratio of managers to their direct reports will limit the size of an effective organization.\n", "13.5.j. Consider succession and training in your design. This is a subject I wish I had thought about much earlier in my career. To ensure that your organization continues to deliver results, you need to build a perpetual motion machine that can work well without you. This involves more than the mechanics of your own \u201cstepping out,\u201d but the selection and training and governance of the new leaders who \u201cstep up,\u201d and most importantly, the preservation of the culture and its values. The best approach I\u2019ve seen for doing this is what companies and organizations like GE, 3G, and the Chinese Politburo do, which is to build a pyramid-like \u201csuccession pipeline\u201d in which the next generation of leaders is exposed to the thinking and decision making of the current leaders so they can both learn and be tested.\n", "13.5.k. Don\u2019t just pay attention to your job; pay attention to how your job will be done if you are no longer around. I wrote about key-man risk earlier, which applies the most to those with the largest areas of responsibility, especially the head of an organization. If that\u2019s you, then you should designate the people who could replace you and have them do your job for a while so they can be vetted and tested. These results should be documented in a manual that the appropriate people can go to if you should be hit by a bus. If all the key people in the organization do this, you will have a strong \u201cfarm team,\u201d or at least a clear understanding of vulnerabilities and a plan to deal with them. Remember that a ninja manager is somebody who can sit back and watch beauty happen\u2014i.e., an orchestrator. If you are always trying to hire somebody who is as good as or better than you at your job, that will both free you up to go on to other things and build your succession pipeline. Beyond that, visualizing your replacement is an enlightening and productive experience. In addition to taking stock of what you are doing and coming up with both bad and good names, you will start to think about how to get your best people into slots that don\u2019t yet exist. Knowing that you will have to test them by letting them do your job without interference, you will be motivated to train them properly before the test. And, of course, the stress-testing will help you learn and adapt, which will lead to better results.\n", "13.5.l. Use \u201cdouble-do\u201d rather than \u201cdouble-check\u201d to make sure mission-critical tasks are done correctly. Double-checking has a much higher rate of errors than double-doing, which is having two different people do the same task so that they produce two independent answers. This not only ensures better answers but will allow you to see the differences in people\u2019s performance and abilities. I use double-do\u2019s in critical areas such as finance, where large amounts of money are at risk. And because an audit is only as effective as the auditor is knowledgeable, remember that a good double-check can only be done by someone capable of double-doing. If the person double-checking the work isn\u2019t capable of doing the work himself, how could he possibly evaluate it accurately?\n", "13.5.m. Use consultants wisely and watch out for consultant addiction. Sometimes hiring an external consultant is the best fit for your design. Doing so can get you precisely the amount of specialized expertise you need to tackle a problem. When you can outsource you don\u2019t have to worry about managing, and that\u2019s a real advantage. If a position is part-time and requires highly specialized knowledge, I would prefer to have it done by consultants or outsiders. At the same time, you need to beware of the chronic use of consultants to do work that should be done by employees. This will cost you in the long run and erode your culture. Also make sure you are careful not to ask consultants to do things that they don\u2019t normally do. They will almost certainly revert to doing things in their usual way; their own employers will demand that. When evaluating whether to use a consultant, consider the following factors:\n", "1. Quality Control. When someone doing work for you is an employee, you are responsible for the quality of their work. But when the person working for you works for another company, you\u2019re operating by their standards, so it\u2019s important to know whether their standards are as high or higher than yours.\n", "2. Economics. If a full-time person is required, it is almost certainly more cost-effective to create a position. Consultants\u2019 daily rates add up to considerably more than the annualized cost of a full-time person.\n", "3. Institutionalization of Knowledge. Someone who is around your environment on an ongoing basis will gain knowledge and an appreciation of your culture that no outsider can.\n", "4. Security. Having outsiders do the job substantially increases your security risks, especially if you can\u2019t see them at work (and monitor whether they follow proper precautions, like not leaving sensitive documents on their desks).\n", "You have to consider whether you should be outsourcing or developing capabilities in-house.

No one is perfect, everyone has strengths and weaknesses, and as hard as you look, you won\u2019t always be able to find everything you want in one person. So look down on your machine and the people you choose for your roles, and think about where you might need to supplement your design by adding people or processes to ensure that each job is done excellently. Remember, guardrailing is meant to help people who can by and large do their jobs well\u2014it\u2019s intended to help good people perform better, not to help failing people reach the bar. If you\u2019re trying to guardrail someone who is missing the core abilities required for their job, you should probably just fire them and look for someone else who will be a better click. A good guardrail typically takes the form of a team member whose strengths compensate for the weaknesses of the team member who needs to be guardrailed. A good guardrailing relationship should be firm without being overly rigid. Ideally, it should work like two people dancing\u2014they\u2019re literally pushing against each other, but with a lot of mutual give-and-take. Of course, having someone in a job who needs to be guardrailed is not as good as having someone in a job who will naturally do the right things. Strive for that.\n", "13.7.a.

I constantly see people form wrong opinions and make bad decisions, even though they\u2019ve made the same kinds of mistakes before\u2014and even though they know that doing so is illogical and harmful. I used to think that they would avoid these pitfalls when they became aware of their blind spots, but typically that\u2019s not the case. Only very rarely do I hear someone recuse himself from offering an opinion because they aren\u2019t capable of forming a good one in a particular area.

That can happen for organizations in much the same way as it happens for families and communities. To help nurture that, it is desirable to reinforce the traditions and reasons for them, as well as to make sure the values and strategic goals are imbued in the successive leaders and the population as a whole.\n", "13.8.a. Don\u2019t put the expedient ahead of the strategic. People often tell me they can\u2019t deal with the longer-term strategic issues because they have too many pressing issues they need to solve right away. But rushing into ad hoc solutions while kicking the proverbial can down the road is a \u201cpath to slaughter.\u201d Effective managers pay attention both to imminent problems and to problems that haven\u2019t hit them yet. They constantly feel the tug of the strategic path because they worry about not getting to their ultimate goal and they are determined to continue their process of discovery until they do. While they might not have the answer right away, and they might not be able to come up with it by themselves, through a combination of creativity and character they eventually make all the necessary upward loops.\n", "13.8.b. Think about both the big picture and the granular details, and understand the connections between them. Avoid fixating on irrelevant details. You have to determine what\u2019s important and what\u2019s unimportant at each level. For example, imagine you are designing a house. First you need to start with the big picture: Your house will sit on a plot of land, and you have to think through where the water comes from, how the house gets hooked up to the power grid, and so on. Then you need to decide how many rooms it will have, where the doors will go, where you need windows, and so on. When designing the plan, you need to think about all of these things and connect them, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you actually need to go out and pick the hinges for the door yourself.

Even a tiny amount of cheating is intolerable, so your happiness and success will depend on your controls. I have repeatedly learned this lesson the hard way.\n", "13.9.a. Investigate and let people know you are going to investigate. Investigate and explain to people that you are going to investigate so there are no surprises. Security controls should not be taken personally by the people being checked, just like a teller shouldn\u2019t view the bank counting the money in the drawer (rather than just accepting the teller\u2019s count) as an indication that the bank thinks the teller is dishonest. Explain that concept to employees so that they understand it. But even the best controls will never be foolproof. For that reason (among many others), trustworthiness is a quality that should be appreciated.\n", "13.9.b. Remember that there is no sense in having laws unless you have policemen (auditors). The people doing the auditing should report to people outside the department being audited, and auditing procedures should not be made known to those being audited.

When a person\u2019s role involves reviewing or auditing a high volume of transactions or things that other people are doing, there\u2019s a real risk of rubber-stamping. One particularly risky example is expense approvals. Make sure you have ways to audit the auditors.\n", "13.9.d. Recognize that people who make purchases on your behalf probably will not spend your money wisely. This is because 1) it is not their money and 2) it is difficult to know what the right price should be. For example, if somebody proposes a price of $125,000 for a consulting project, it is unpleasant, difficult, and confusing to figure out what the market rate is and then negotiate a better price. But the same person who\u2019s reluctant to negotiate with the consultant will bargain furiously when he is hiring someone to paint his own house.

Dual reporting causes confusion, complicates prioritization, diminishes focus on clear goals, and muddies the lines of supervision and accountability\u2014especially when the supervisors are in two different departments. When situations require dual reporting, managers need to be informed. Asking someone from another department to do a task without consulting with his or her manager is strictly prohibited (unless the request will take less than an hour or so). However, appointing co-heads of a department or a sub-department can work well if the managers are in sync and combine complementary and essential strengths; dual reporting in that case can work well if properly coordinated.\n", "13.10.a.

Constantly think about how to produce leverage. Leverage in an organization is not unlike leverage in the markets; you\u2019re looking for ways to achieve more with less. At Bridgewater, I typically work at about 50:1 leverage, meaning that for every hour I spend with each person who works for me, they spend about fifty hours working to move the project along. At our sessions, we go over the vision and the deliverables, then they work on them, and then we review the work, and they move forward based on my feedback\u2014and we do that over and over again. The people who work for me typically have similar relationships with those who work for them, though their ratios are typically between 10:1 and 20:1. I am always eager to find people who can do things nearly as well as (and ideally better than) I can so that I can maximize my output per hour. Technology is another great tool for providing leverage. To make training as easy to leverage as possible, document the most common questions and answers through audio, video, or written guidelines, and then assign someone to organize them and incorporate them into a manual, which is updated on a regular basis. Principles themselves are a form of leverage\u2014they\u2019re a way to compound your understanding of situations so that you don\u2019t need to exert the same effort each time you encounter a problem.\n", "13.10.c.

Great people and great technology both enhance productivity. Put them together in a well-designed machine and they improve it exponentially.\n", "13.10.d. Use leveragers. Leveragers are people who can go from conceptual to practical effectively and do the most to get your concepts implemented.

There were thousands of pages, most covered with my scribbles, and I realized that they represented just a fraction of the effort I\u2019d put in. At our fortieth-year celebration I was given copies of the almost ten thousand Bridgewater Daily Observations that we\u2019d published. Every one of them expressed our deepest thinking and research about markets and economies. I also stumbled across the manuscript of an eight-hundred-page book that I wrote but then got too busy to publish, and countless other memos and letters to clients, research reports, and versions of the book you\u2019re reading now. Why did I do all these things? Why do others work so hard to achieve their goals?\n", "From what I can see, we do it for different reasons. For me, the main reason is that I can visualize the results of pushing through so intensely that I experience the thrill of success even while I\u2019m still struggling to achieve it. Similarly, I can visualize the tragic results of not pushing through. I am also motivated by a sense of responsibility; I have a hard time letting people I care about down. But that\u2019s just what\u2019s true for me. Others describe their motivation as attachment to the community and its mission. Some do it for approval and some do it for financial rewards. All these are perfectly acceptable motivations and should be used and harmonized in a way consistent with the culture.\n", "The way one brings people together to do this is key. This is what most people call \u201cleadership.\u201d What are the most important things that a leader needs to do in order to get their organizations to push through to results?

While there might be more glamour in coming up with the brilliant new ideas, most of success comes from doing the mundane and often distasteful stuff, like identifying and dealing with problems and pushing hard over a long time. This was certainly the case with the Client Service Department. Through a lot of relentless hard work in the years since the original problem turned up, the department has become an example to other teams at Bridgewater\u2014and our client satisfaction levels remain consistently high. The great irony of all this is that none of our clients ever even noticed the problems we saw with the memos. Sending out work not up to our standards was bad\u2014and I\u2019m glad it was corrected.

Be coordinated and consistent in motivating others. Managing groups to push through to results can be done emotionally or intellectually, and by carrots or by sticks. While we each have our own reasons for working, there are unique challenges and advantages to motivating a community. The main challenge is the need to coordinate, i.e., to get in sync on the reasons for pursuing a goal and the best way to do it. For example, you wouldn\u2019t want one group to be motivated and compensated so differently from another (one gets big bonuses for example, and another doesn\u2019t under the same set of circumstances) that the differences cause problems. The main advantage of working in groups is that it\u2019s easier to design a group to include all the qualities needed to be successful than to find all those qualities in one person. As with the steps in the 5-Step Process, some people are great at one step and some are terrible at that step. But it doesn\u2019t matter which is the case when everyone is clear on each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and the group is designed to deal with those realities.\n", "14.1.b.

Look for creative, cut-through solutions. When people are facing thorny problems or have too much to do, they often think that they need to work harder. But if something seems hard, time-consuming, and frustrating, take some time to step back and triangulate with others on whether there might be a better way to handle it. Of course, many things that need getting done are just a slog, but it\u2019s often the case that there are better solutions out there that you\u2019re not seeing.\n"], "Recognize that everyone has too much to do.": ["Recognize that everyone has too much to do.\n", "How to do more than we think we can is a puzzle we all struggle with. Other than working harder for longer hours, there are three ways to fix the problem: 1) having fewer things to do by prioritizing and saying no, 2) finding the right people to delegate to, and 3) improving your productivity. Some people spend a lot of time and effort accomplishing very little while others do a lot in the same amount of time. What differentiates people who can do a lot from those who can\u2019t is creativity, character, and wisdom. Those with more creativity invent ways to do things more effectively (for instance by finding good people, good technologies, and/or good designs). Those with more character are better able to wrestle with their challenges and demands. And those with more wisdom can maintain their equanimity by going to the higher level and looking down on themselves and their challenges to properly prioritize, realistically design, and make sensible choices.\n", "14.2.a.

Winston Churchill hit the nail on the head when he said, \u201cSuccess consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\u201d You will come to enjoy this process of careening between success and failure because it will determine your trajectory.

Rather than be above the principles, the people responsible for running the organization must be evaluated, chosen, and\u2014if needed\u2014replaced in an evidence-based way according to rules, just like everyone else in the organization. Their strengths and weaknesses, like everyone\u2019s, must be taken into consideration. Collecting objective data about all people is essential for this. And you need good tools to convert data into decisions in agreed-upon ways. Moreover, the tools allow the people and the system to work together in a symbiotic way to improve each other.\n", "15.1.a. To produce real behavioral change, understand that there must be internalized or habituated learning. Thankfully, technology has made internalized learning much easier today than it was when books were the primary way of conveying knowledge. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the book was a powerful invention. Johannes Gutenberg\u2019s printing press allowed easy dissemination of knowledge that helped people build on each other\u2019s learnings. But experiential learning is so much more powerful. Now that technology makes it so easy to create experiential/virtual learning, I believe that we are on the brink of another step-change improvement in the quality of learning that will be as great as or even greater than Gutenberg\u2019s. We have been trying to create internalized learning at Bridge-water for a long time, so how we do it has evolved a lot. Since we tape virtually all our meetings, we have been able to create virtual learning case studies that allow everyone to participate without actually being in the room. People see the meeting transpire as though they were in it, and then the case study pauses and asks them for their own thinking on the matter at hand. In some cases, they input their reactions in real time as they watch. Their thinking is recorded and compared with others\u2019 using expert systems that help us all understand more about how we think. With this information, we can better tailor their learning and their job assignments to their thinking styles. That is just one example of a number of tools and protocols we have developed to help our people learn and operate by our principles.\n", "15.1.b. Use tools to collect data and process it into conclusions and actions. Imagine that virtually everything important going on in your company can be captured as data, and that you can build algorithms to instruct the computer, as you would instruct a person, to analyze that data and use it in the way you agreed it should be used. In that way, you and the computer on your behalf could look at each person and all the people together and provide tailored guidance, just like your GPS provides you guidance by knowing all the traffic patterns and routes. You don\u2019t have to make it mandatory to follow that guidance, though you can. Generally speaking, the system operates like a coach. And the coach can learn about its team: Data is collected about what people do so that if they make more insightful moves or less insightful moves, learning will occur and be used to create improvements. Because the thinking behind the algorithms is available to everyone, anyone can assess the quality of the logic and its fairness, and have a hand in shaping it.\n", "15.1.c. Foster an environment of confidence and fairness by having clearly-stated principles that are implemented in tools and protocols so that the conclusions reached can be assessed by tracking the logic and data behind them. In all organizations, it\u2019s always the case that some of the people judged to be ineffective will argue that those judgments are wrong. When that happens, a data- and rules-based system with clearly laid-out criteria allows less room for such arguments and greater belief that the system is fair. Though the system won\u2019t be perfect, it is much less arbitrary\u2014and can much more easily be examined for bias\u2014than the much less specified and much less open decision making of individuals with authority. My ideal is to have a process in which everyone contributes criteria for good decision making and those criteria are assessed and selected by appropriately assigned (believable) people. If people maintain the right balance of open-mindedness and assertiveness so they understand where they are and aren\u2019t believable to make decisions, having these open discussions on the criteria for assessing and managing people can be very powerful in building and reinforcing the idea meritocracy. We have early-stage tools that achieve these things and we are striving to refine them so that our people management system operates as effectively as our investment management system. Even with its imperfections, our evidence-based approach to learning about people, guiding them, and sorting them is much fairer and more effective than the arbitrary and subjective management systems that most organizations still rely on. I believe that the forces of evolution will push most organizations toward systems that combine human and computer intelligence to program principles into algorithms that substantially improve decision making.\n", "16 And for Heaven\u2019s Sake, Don\u2019t Overlook Governance! All that I\u2019ve said thus far will be useless if you don\u2019t have good governance. Governance is the oversight system that removes the people and the processes if they aren\u2019t working well. It is the process that checks and balances power to assure that the principles and interests of the community as a whole are always placed above the interests and power of any individual or faction. Because power will rule, power must be put in the hands of capable people in key roles who have the right values, do their jobs well, and will check and balance the power of others. I didn\u2019t realize the importance of this sort of governance until after I transitioned out of the CEO role, because I was an entrepreneur and company builder (as well as an investment manager) who largely did what I thought was best. While I needed and developed double-checks on myself\u2014I created a Management Committee that I put above me so that I had to report to it\u2014I always had the power of my equity to change things, though I never used it. Some might say that I was a benevolent despot because while I had all the power (the complete voting rights), I exercised my power in an idea-meritocratic way, recognizing that the good of the whole was best for us all, and that I needed to be double-checked. I certainly did not create the sort of governance system appropriate for Bridgewater, given its scale. For example, Bridgewater didn\u2019t have a board of directors overseeing the CEOs, there were no internal regulations, no judicial system for people to appeal to, and no enforcement system, because we didn\u2019t need them. I, with the help of others, simply created the rules and enforced them, though everyone had the right to appeal and overturn my and others\u2019 judgments. Our principles were the equivalent of what the Articles of Confederation had been to the United States in its first years, and our policies were like our laws, but I never created a formal way of operating such as a \u201cConstitution\u201d or a justice system to enforce them and resolve disputes. As a result, when I stepped out and passed the power to others, confusions about decision rights arose. After conferring with some of the world\u2019s greatest experts on governance, we put a new system in place based on these principles. Still, I want to make clear that I don\u2019t consider myself an expert on governance and can\u2019t vouch for the following principles as much as I can vouch for the previous ones, because they are still new as of this writing.\n"], "To be successful, all organizations must have checks and balances.": ["To be successful, all organizations must have checks and balances.\n", "By checks, I mean people who check on other people to make sure they\u2019re performing well, and by balances, I mean balances of power. Even the most benevolent leaders are prone to becoming more autocratic, if for no other reason than because managing a lot of people and having limited time to do it requires them to make numerous difficult choices quickly, and they sometimes lose patience with arguments and issue commands instead. And most leaders are not so benevolent that they can be trusted to put the organization\u2019s interests ahead of their own.\n", "16.1.a. Even in an idea meritocracy, merit cannot be the only determining factor in assigning responsibility and authority. Appropriate vested interests also need to be taken into consideration. For example, the owners of a company might have vested interests that they are perfectly entitled to that might be at odds with the vested interests of the people in the company who, based on the idea meritocracy, are most believable. That should not lead the owners to simply turn over the keys to those leaders. That conflict has to be worked out. Since the purpose of the idea meritocracy is to produce the best results, and the owners have the rights and powers to assess that, of course they will make the determination\u2014though I recommend they choose wisely.\n", "16.1.b. Make sure that no one is more powerful than the system or so important that they are irreplaceable. For an idea meritocracy, it is especially important that its governance system is more powerful than any individual\u2014and that it directs and constrains its leaders rather than the other way around. The Chinese leader Wang Qishan drew my attention to what happened in ancient Rome when Julius Caesar revolted against the government, defeated his fellow general Pompey, seized control of the Republic from the Senate, and named himself emperor for life. Even after he was assassinated and governance by the Senate was restored, Rome would never again be what it was; the era of civil strife that followed was more damaging than any foreign war.\n", "16.1.c. Beware of fiefdoms. While it\u2019s great for teams and departments to feel a strong bond of shared purpose, loyalty to a boss or department head cannot be allowed to conflict with loyalty to the organization as a whole. Fiefdoms are counterproductive and contrary to the values of an idea meritocracy.\n", "16.1.d. Make clear that the organization\u2019s structure and rules are designed to ensure that its checks-and-balances system functions well. Every organization has its own way of doing this. The diagram on the next page is a sketch of my conceptualization of how this should work for Bridgewater, which is currently an organization of about 1,500 people. The principles it follows, however, are universal; I believe that all organizations need some version of this basic structure. There are one to three chairmen working with seven to fifteen board members supported by staff, whose purpose is primarily to assess whether: 1) The people running the company are capable; 2) The company is operating in accordance with its agreed-upon principles and rules. The board has the power to select and replace the CEOs, but doesn\u2019t engage in the micromanagement of the firm nor the people running it, though in the event of an emergency, they can drop into a more active role. (They can also help the CEOs to the extent they want it.) While Bridgewater\u2019s idea meritocracy is ideally all-inclusive, there need to be various circles of authority, trust and access to information, and decision-making authority, which are shown in the chart\u2019s three circles.\n", "16.1.e. Make sure reporting lines are clear. While this is important throughout the organization, it is especially important that the reporting lines of the board (those doing the oversight) are independent of the reporting lines of the CEOs (those doing the management), though there should be cooperation between them.\n", "16.1.f. Make sure decision rights are clear. Make sure it\u2019s clear how much weight each person\u2019s vote has so that if a decision must be made when there is still disagreement, there is no doubt how to resolve it.\n", "16.1.g. Make sure that the people doing the assessing 1) have the time to be fully informed about how the person they are checking on is doing, 2) have the ability to make the assessments, and 3) are not in a conflict of interest that stands in the way of carrying out oversight effectively. In order to assess well, one has to gain a threshold level of understanding and that takes time. Some people have the ability and the courage to hold people accountable, while most don\u2019t; having such ability and courage is essential. And the person doing the assessing must not have conflicts of interest\u2014such as being in a subordinate position to the person they are intended to check on\u2014that stand in the way of holding them accountable, including recommending that they be fired.\n", "16.1.h. Recognize that decision makers must have access to the information necessary to make decisions and must be trustworthy enough to handle that information safely. That doesn\u2019t mean that all people must have access and be trustworthy. It is possible to have subcommittees who have access to sensitive information and make recommendations to the board that are substantiated with enough information to make good judgments, but without disclosing the highly sensitive particulars.\n"], "Remember that in an idea meritocracy a single CEO is not as good as a great group of leaders.": ["Remember that in an idea meritocracy a single CEO is not as good as a great group of leaders.\n", "Dependence on one person produces too much key-man risk, limits the range of expertise (because nobody is good at everything), and fails to establish adequate checks and balances. It also creates a burden because there\u2019s generally too much to do. That\u2019s why we have a co-CEO model at Bridgewater that is essentially a partnership of two or three people who lead the firm. At Bridgewater the CEOs are overseen by a board largely via the executive chairman or chairmen. In our idea meritocracy, the CEOs are also held accountable by the employees of the company, even though these employees are subordinate to the CEOs. The challenge of having two or three people is for them to dance well together. If they can\u2019t do that, and coordinate well with the chairmen, they have to notify the executive chairman or chairmen so changes can be made. For the same reason we have more than one CEO overseeing management of the company, we have more than one chief investment officer (there are currently three).\n"]}
